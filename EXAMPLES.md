# Tag Implementation Examples

## Before & After Examples

### Example 1: AI Workflows Post
**File**: `50-of-ai-later-lessons-from-burning-credits-fast.mdx`
- **Before**: `ai`, `field-notes`, `tools`, `workflow`
- **After**: `ai-workflows`, `craft`
- **Rationale**: Core AI content + hands-on building focus

### Example 2: Leadership Post
**File**: `coach-up-or-coach-out-what-i-look-for-early.mdx`
- **Before**: `leadership`, `consulting-in-practice`, `point-of-view`, `signal-vs-noise`
- **After**: `consulting-practice`, `leadership`
- **Rationale**: Removed style tags, kept meaningful categories

### Example 3: Personal Growth Post
**File**: `living-in-the-comments.mdx`
- **Before**: `identity`, `meta-on-meta`, `reflection`
- **After**: `personal-growth`, `systems-thinking`
- **Rationale**: Mapped identity/reflection → personal-growth, meta → systems-thinking

### Example 4: Commerce Strategy Post
**File**: `is-composable-just-ikea-for-commerce.mdx`
- **Before**: `commerce`, `strategy`, `signal-vs-noise`, `commerce-drift`
- **After**: `commerce-strategy`, `systems-thinking`
- **Rationale**: Consolidated commerce tags, added systems-thinking for architectural analysis

### Example 5: Multi-Theme Post
**File**: `the-human-loom.mdx`
- **Before**: `leadership`, `consulting-in-practice`, `reflection`, `strategy`, `meta-on-meta`
- **After**: `consulting-practice`, `leadership`, `personal-growth`, `systems-thinking`
- **Rationale**: Rich post touching multiple themes (4 tags appropriate)

### Example 6: Previously Untagged
**File**: `how-i-work-with-ais-and-why.mdx`
- **Before**: (no tags)
- **After**: `ai-workflows`, `systems-thinking`
- **Rationale**: Core AI workflow post with systems/architecture focus

## Tag Mapping Logic Examples

### Identity/Reflection Posts → Personal Growth
- `identity` → `personal-growth`
- `reflection` → `personal-growth`
- `philosophy` → `personal-growth`
- `muscle-memory` → `personal-growth`

### Meta/Systems Posts → Systems Thinking
- `meta-on-meta` → `systems-thinking`
- `grid-level-thinking` → `systems-thinking`
- Some `strategy` → `systems-thinking` (when architecture-focused)

### AI/Workflow Posts → AI Workflows
- `ai` → `ai-workflows`
- `workflow` → `ai-workflows`
- Some `tools` → `ai-workflows` (when AI-focused)

### Commerce Posts → Commerce Strategy
- `commerce` → `commerce-strategy`
- `commerce-drift` → `commerce-strategy`
- Some `strategy` → `commerce-strategy` (when business-focused)

### Consulting Posts → Consulting Practice
- `consulting-in-practice` → `consulting-practice`

### Building Posts → Craft
- Some `tools` → `craft` (when photography/building focused)

## Removed Tags (Style/Navigation)

These tags were removed as they describe style/navigation rather than content themes:

- `field-notes` - Publication style
- `point-of-view` - Voice/perspective marker
- `signal-vs-noise` - Meta commentary tag
- `start-here` - Navigation tag
- `false-exemption` - Style marker
- `post-creation-process` - Meta tag

**Impact**: Removed from 119 posts, cleaned up tag noise significantly.
