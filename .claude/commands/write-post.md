FIRST: Read `/docs/signal-dispatch-voice-guide.md` to understand the voice and structural patterns.

Then help the user:

1. **Identify the Hook**: What's the tension, question, or uncomfortable truth?
2. **Choose Structure**: Which template from the voice guide fits best?
   - Reflection Post
   - Technical Deep-Dive
   - Leadership Insight
   - Origin Story
3. **Draft Following Patterns**:
   - Open with tension (never thesis)
   - Show the work
   - Include self-interrogation
   - Use bold headers
   - End provisionally
4. **Create Frontmatter**: Generate proper metadata
5. **Review Against Checklist**: Verify voice authenticity

Ask clarifying questions as needed. Show examples from the voice guide when helpful.
