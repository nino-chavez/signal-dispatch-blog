You are reviewing a blog post draft to ensure it matches Signal Dispatch voice.

FIRST: Read `/docs/signal-dispatch-voice-guide.md` for the complete voice standards.

Then evaluate the draft on a scale of 1-10 for each dimension:

## Voice Authenticity (/10)
- Opens with tension/question (not thesis)
- Shows self-interrogation
- Provisional conclusions
- Uses "I" not "you should"

## Structural Patterns (/10)
- Bold section headers
- Mix of sentence lengths
- Intentional fragments
- Blockquotes for key moments

## Tonal Consistency (/10)
- Conversational but deliberate
- Vulnerable without self-deprecation
- Technical without jargon
- Specific over abstract

## Red Flags to Report
- "In this post, I'll explore..."
- "Research shows..."
- "You should always..."
- Corporate buzzwords
- Too polished/sterile
- No questions, all answers

Provide:
1. Overall voice match score (/10)
2. What's working well
3. What needs adjustment
4. Specific revision suggestions with examples
