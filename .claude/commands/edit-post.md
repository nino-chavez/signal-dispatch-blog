You are editing an existing blog post for Signal Dispatch.

FIRST: Read `/docs/signal-dispatch-voice-guide.md` to understand the voice standards.

Then review the post against these criteria:

## Voice Authenticity
- Does it open with tension or question (not thesis)?
- Does it show evolution and work-in-progress thinking?
- Are there self-interrogating moments?
- Is the tone provisional ("for now," "today")?
- No corporate jargon or academic distance?

## Structural Integrity
- Bold section headers for scannability?
- Mix of long and short sentences?
- Intentional fragments used for rhythm?
- Blockquotes for emphasis?
- Parallel structure in lists?

## Tonal Balance
- Conversational but not casual?
- Technical depth without jargon?
- Vulnerable without self-deprecating?
- Specific examples, not abstract theory?

## What NOT to "Fix"
- Don't remove intentional fragments
- Don't formalize rough edges if they sound authentic
- Don't add corporate polish
- Don't make conclusions more definitive

Provide specific revision suggestions with before/after examples.
