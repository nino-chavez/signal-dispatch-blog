This is Post 1 of 4 in the **Grid-Level Thinking** series.
Explore the full series [*here*](/tag/grid-level-thinking/)*.*

I’m watching people treat AI like it’s going to do their job *for* them.

It won’t.

It’s not a strategy. It’s not a shortcut. And it’s definitely not a vision.

At best, it’s a utility.
It’s the power grid.
It’s on. It’s live. It’s humming.

But you still need to wire something. You still need a blueprint.
Otherwise you’re just staring at an outlet wondering why nothing’s changed.

LLMs are **raw current**. That’s it.
They don’t build anything for you.

They respond. They assist. But they don’t choose.
They don’t know what matters.
They don’t understand tradeoffs.

If your system is unclear, AI won’t fix that.
It’ll just make your mess faster.

That’s the gap I’m seeing.

Everyone’s trying to **plug in**.
Almost no one’s trying to **wire in**.

Plugging in is passive.
Wiring in is design.

It means knowing where your thinking gets stuck.
Where decisions slow down.
Where clarity breaks.

You don’t need more power.
You need to know what to do with it.
