*Post 2 of 5 in Muscle Memory*

Let me be honest: ChatGPT writes a better first draft than I do.

It’s quick. It’s organized. It has the tone dialed in. But sometimes, I read back what it wrote and realize—I didn’t really *write* this. I just nodded along and hit paste.

That’s where the line blurs. Between speed and authorship. Between clarity and mimicry.

The value of writing isn’t just getting it done—it’s wrestling through the fog until you say something that’s *yours*. If I skip that, I’m not thinking. I’m just reacting.

The scary part isn’t that AI writes for me. It’s that it might *replace* the process that makes me better at thinking in the first place.
