Last week, I said the storefront is dead.
Not ecommerce itself—but the idea that your website experience is the main driver of customer connection or conversion.

If people aren’t exploring your site anymore, if they’re just showing up to confirm what they already decided—then the question becomes:
**Where are they deciding?**

That’s where the new game is.

So where do you compete now?1. **Upstream. Before the click.**Your storefront isn’t the discovery layer anymore. That work is happening on social, in search snippets, creator content, text threads, DMs, and short-form reels. That’s where people are building trust and forming intent.

If your strategy still starts with the homepage, you're already late.

2. **In the content, not the container.**Brand stories don’t live in your hero carousel. They live in clips, in visuals, in athlete endorsements, in who shares your product and *why*. The site still has a role—it just isn’t your point of persuasion anymore.

That means content *is* your customer journey. Not just marketing.

3. **In the frictionless follow-through.**You still need to execute. That means fast site load, clear product pages, and zero barriers to checkout. But the difference is: this isn’t where you win. This is where you fulfill.

Your site isn’t the battlefield. It’s the delivery vehicle.

What does this mean for operators?- If you’re still budgeting like the homepage is your storefront window, realign your spend.
- If your creative team is building site banners more than they’re building modular, reusable content drops—you’re missing the compounding effect of actual visibility.
- If your media isn’t feeding your commerce engine, you’re not connecting demand to conversion.

This doesn’t mean UX is dead.
It means UX needs to move off-site, into wherever your audience already is.

So what should you be building now?- A modular content system—not just a CMS
- A brand that travels—one that holds up in the wild, not just in your style guide
- A funnel that starts with **trust** and ends with **zero decision fatigue**
- An ops model that rewards *agility*, not *extension*

The storefront is dead.
The shelf is anywhere your customer’s attention goes.
And the new competition?
It’s for trust, relevance, and velocity.

If you're not playing there, you're not in the game.
