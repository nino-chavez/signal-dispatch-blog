We don’t grow by knowing — we grow by questioning.

In my own experience, this shows up most clearly when things start to feel stuck — when the team is spinning on a problem or a solution just isn’t landing. I’ve learned to use that moment of frustration or confusion as a trigger to ask:
**“What am I not understanding?”**

It’s a small shift, but it’s everything.
Instead of defaulting to “they’re not explaining it clearly” or “this shouldn’t be that hard,” I turn the lens inward. Not from a place of blame, but from a place of *curiosity*. Often, my own incredulous reactions are really masking that internal voice asking:
**“Am I dumb? What am I missing here?”**

But that question is actually a superpower — a signal that there’s something valuable I haven’t seen yet.

As leaders, we model the culture we want. If we stay coachable, open to reframing, and willing to admit when we don’t get it… our teams will too.
