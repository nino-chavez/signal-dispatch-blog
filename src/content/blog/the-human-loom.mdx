Some people walk into a room and light it up with ideas. Others walk in and quietly start weaving.

This is a post for the second group.

In consulting and leadership, there's a quiet type of value that often goes unnamed. You're not the loudest. You’re not the one scribbling on the whiteboard. But you’re the one who, when everyone leaves, knows where the signal was hiding in the noise.

You’re the loom. The tension-holder. The structure that lets disparate threads become something coherent.

Recognizing Loom EnergyYou might be the loom if:

- You find patterns in messy conversations.
- You don’t panic when things feel vague—you wait.
- You often say, "Here's what I think we're actually trying to solve."
- People start asking you to summarize the room.
- You feel the most useful when everyone else is a little bit lost.

This isn’t about being passive. It’s about being patient. Strategic. Oriented toward synthesis.

In Consulting: You’re Not the Spark, You’re the FrameMost good consulting looks like this: stakeholders with loud opinions, data that contradicts itself, pressure to move fast. It's tempting to charge forward with a plan. But the real value often lies in reframing the mess before executing a response.

If you’re a loom, your job is to:

- Sit in ambiguity long enough to spot the recurring tensions.
- Ask the second-order questions.
- Create just enough structure so others can find their footing.

That structure might be a new operating model, a rephrased vision, or simply the right sentence at the right moment. Whatever it is, it turns chaos into forward motion.

In Leadership: Weaving, Not WieldingLoom-style leadership is rarely flashy. You won’t always get credit. But people feel safer around you. They get clearer. You help them hear themselves.

You:

- Hold space instead of filling it.
- Model calm in complexity.
- Let others bring the thread, but you shape the pattern.

It’s slow work. Invisible work. But over time, you end up with a tapestry—cohesion, trust, direction—where there was once just noise.

A Final ThoughtLeadership doesn’t always look like pushing. Sometimes it looks like weaving.

Not everyone needs to be the signal. Some of us are here to make signal possible.
