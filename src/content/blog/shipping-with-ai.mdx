People ask if I’m doing model tuning, building agents, writing Python tools, or something else with AI.

I build with AI to move real work. Shipping means a real object changed in a real system. There is a link, an owner, a date, and a small metric that moved. If I can’t point to those, it was practice.

I ship in multiple lanes: posts, day-to-day tasks, media, research & learning, and code.

Posts I use AI to get from idea to draft fast. I keep the voice pass and final edit. Then I publish the same day when it’s ready. Proof is the post URL. The metric is draft-to-done time. My average moved from three to four hours per post to about ninety minutes for most pieces. Heavy posts still take longer, but the lift is real because starts are faster and revisions are tighter.

Day-to-day tasks Email, doc review, and doc generation are steady gains. AI drafts clear emails so I can set the ask and deadline. For reviews, I pull risks, questions, and next steps, then assign owners. For new docs, I ask for a one-pager or a table to start structure. Proof is the ticket or thread link. The metric is cycle time to a decision and rework rate. Fewer back-and-forth turns add up over a week.

Media I shoot matches and events. Volume matters, but taste still wins. AI helps with first-pass selects, captions, and a posting plan. I make the final choices. Proof is a gallery or reel link. The metric is time to deliver and template reuse. Delivery in hours beats delivery in days, and clients notice.

Code I write intent and constraints. AI drafts scaffolds, tests, and routine glue. I enforce types, patterns, flags, and I own the merges. Proof is the PR and the feature flag. The metric is lead time per change and PR rework rate. Boilerplate drops. Reviews stay focused on design, not syntax. Rollbacks stay easy because flags and tests are in place.

I keep a simple ledger so this stays honest. One line per item: object, link, metric, and one note. Example lines: a post with time saved, a client thread with fewer turns, a gallery delivered faster, a feature merged sooner. The point is traceable work, not vibes.

When I evaluate vendor AI, I ask three things. What exact object changes, and where does it live. What is the approval and rollback path. How do I see lift in my numbers, not theirs. If these answers are vague, I pass. If they are clear, I run a small pilot with guardrails.

Teams do not need to jump to full automation. Start with assist, where AI drafts and humans decide. Move to automate in low-risk steps with clear owners. Orchestrate only when you can watch, undo, and measure. You climb by adding feedback, not by adding buzzwords.

If you want a plan, keep it simple. Pick one task in each lane. Write the target metric. Use AI on that task every day for two weeks. Log minutes saved and rework. Publish the ledger and ask one peer to mirror. Three metrics are enough: draft-to-done time, lead time per change, and rework rate.

That is what I mean by shipping with AI. Posts go live. Threads close. Galleries publish. PRs merge. I use AI to start faster, keep pace, and finish more. If you are stuck at awareness, aim for comfort.

Don’t study AI. Use it. One task. Two weeks. Show the proof.

You wouldn’t delay buying a smartphone in 2008. Same deal here. Comfort beats theory. Start now. One task. Daily reps. A link as proof.
