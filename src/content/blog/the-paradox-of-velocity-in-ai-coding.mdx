**Slowing down to speed up (for real this time)**

Two weeks.
That’s how long it took to go from zero to a fully functioning, AI-coded app in production.

And then—in just two days—I had to burn it all down.

Not because the tools failed.
Because I moved too fast.
Because **AI lets you skip to the end** before you understand what it takes to build the middle.

⚡️ Week 1–2: Vibe Coding at Full ThrottleI fell into the exact trap many developers do when working with AI for the first time:** vibe coding**.

It’s fast. It’s fun. It works—until it doesn’t.

With tools like Lovable and Kilo, I was able to:

- Scaffold out full features in hours
- Generate edge functions, DB schemas, and UI hooks in one shot
- Patch bugs with a single prompt
- Deploy to production before I’d even documented anything

It felt like magic.
But here’s the thing about magic: **it doesn't debug itself**.

By the end of Week 2, I had a working app—but I couldn’t trust it anymore.
Under the hood, it was chaos:

- **Type drift** between frontend and backend
- **Styling drift** from semantic tokens to raw Tailwind classes
- **Unlogged changes** to Zod schemas
- **Inconsistent folder conventions**
- Silent breakages caused by copy-pasted-but-regenerated functions that looked identical but behaved differently

Every patch introduced more entropy.
Every AI-assisted “fix” amplified the drift.
Eventually I realized:

**🏚️ It felt like remodeling a 50-year-old house—no permits, no plans.**

> Sure, the walls looked fine at first. But the moment I opened them up?
> No insulation. Live wires spliced with duct tape. Plumbing duct-taped to HVAC.
> *I let AI build fast—but I hadn’t enforced any standards.*
> I could patch it. Paint over it. Hide the drift.
> Or I could tear it down and rebuild it with the structure I wish had been there from the start.

So I shut it all down.
Reset the repo.
Started over.

🧹 Week 3: Slow Is Smooth, Smooth Is FastNow it’s Week 3.

I’m starting from scratch—but this time, I’m **slowing down to speed up**.

Not slowing the AI down.
Slowing *me* down.
Slowing the feedback loop.
Slowing the decisions to ensure they stick.

Because here’s the paradox I’ve now lived firsthand:

> **With AI, you can move fast—but you shouldn’t.**

✅ The AI‑Ops Flow I’m Testing NowThis isn’t a framework. Yet.
But it’s working better than anything I’ve done before. And it’s already showing signs of being teachable, repeatable, and enforceable.

Here’s the loop:

1. 🏗 Bootstrap Prompt FirstNo UI. No features.
Just foundational setup:

- Folder structure
- Type and schema contract boundaries
- Theme token map
- Naming conventions
- Clear file responsibilities

I treat this like setting the load-bearing walls of a house.
No rooms get built until the beams are in place.

2. 🔁 One Feature at a TimeEach new capability gets its own scoped prompt.
No multitask prompts. No “do it all” requests.
Each function, view, or interaction starts with:

> "Here’s the structure. Generate this feature **inside it**."

Once it works, I ask for a **“replay prompt”** to save and reuse later.
That prompt becomes the source of truth for regeneration.

💡**Prompt:** If i wanted you to recreate exactly what you just did for this feature, how would you document that to give back to you as a prompt? feature details, schema, function, etc.3. 📂 Log EverythingTo fight entropy, I log every outcome manually.
Drift, bugs, fixes, conventions—it all gets saved.

```
ai-code-issue-001.log         // Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
ai-code-convention-001.md     // New standards born from an issue
ai-code-drift-001.txt         // Divergence from prior expected behavior
ai-code-review-001.md         // Raw GPT critique of new code
ai-code-review-001-reprompt.md // Refactor prompt based on review

```

Each file represents a breadcrumb in my AI coding journey.
Together, they form the beginning of a **system of record**—a git-like trail for prompt-based coding.

4. 👨‍⚖️ Use World-Class Reviewer ModeI wrote a “world-class software reviewer” prompt stack for ChatGPT.

Every new edge function gets reviewed:

- For structure
- For clarity
- For safety
- For architectural fit

The review + reprompt combo lets me close the loop and **hold the AI accountable** to my conventions, not just its own training.

5. 🛡️ Enforce the Paradox> Slow down.
> Keep the loop tight.
> Don’t let AI outpace your understanding.

I don’t let AI write more code than I can debug.
I don’t let it implement a feature I can’t replay from a clean prompt.
I don’t ship anything until I understand exactly *why* the output works—and *where* it might break.

![](/content/images/2025/08/ai-loop.png" class="kg-image)🔍 Am I Just Reinventing the Wheel?Not exactly.

I went and checked. Others are arriving at similar conclusions:

- **Andrej Karpathy** himself has publicly warned developers to “keep AI on a leash”—calling out how large language models can produce fast but fragile code if you don’t slow the loop ([Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-cofounder-andrej-karpathy-keep-ai-on-the-leash-2025-6?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
- **Security researchers** recently found that nearly **half of AI-generated code** contains vulnerabilities. Especially when developers vibe-code without constraints or review systems ([TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/pro/nearly-half-of-all-code-generated-by-ai-found-to-contain-security-flaws-even-big-llms-affected?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
- A recent **study** on perceived vs. actual productivity with AI tools found that AI feels faster but can often lead to more rework, worse clarity, and slower long-term delivery unless used intentionally ([TIME](https://time.com/7302351/ai-software-coding-study/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
- *Mailchimp’s enterprise use of vibe coding yielded a 40% speed boost—but only after implementing layered governance. They learned that fast requires accountability. I’m applying those lessons at the prompt level with AI‑Ops.* ([ARTIFICIAL IGNORANCE](https://artificialignorance.io/hard-won-vibe-coding-insights-mailchimps-40-speed-gain-came-with-governance-price/))

So yes—I’m circling something real.
But I’m also formalizing it in a way most people haven’t yet.

📦 What’s Still MissingI’ve only just begun.
But even now, I can see what’s next:

- Structured README + developer guide generation
- CI/CD hooks that validate replay prompts and enforce conventions
- Semantic drift detectors for schema/type/style divergence
- A “project memory” dashboard that maps logs and conventions across time
- Full audit trails of AI contributions, versioned like code
- An AI project assistant that acts like a codebase SRE

If this workflow proves sustainable, **I’ll codify the whole thing**.
Not just as a guide—but as a toolkit, a real-world AI‑Ops implementation system.

🧠 Defining AI‑OpsIf DevOps is the discipline of managing code delivery at scale…
And ModelOps is the discipline of managing ML models at scale…

Then **AI‑Ops**, as I’m defining it, is:

> A deliberate engineering methodology where AI-generated code is treated like any operational asset: versioned, reviewed, audited, and continuously governed through prompt conventions, drift controls, RCA cycles, and human-in-the-loop validation.

It’s **not** about building faster.
It’s about building **intentionally**, even when the AI can move faster than you can think.

🏃‍♂️ This Feels Like Couch → 5K → MarathonThree weeks ago, I was barely jogging through AI prompts, just seeing what worked.
Now, I’m running structured loops, tracking issues, logging drift, reviewing every feature.

This isn’t sprinting.
It’s training.

- Week 1: *Couch to 5K* — hype, hallucinations, and a working prototype
- Week 2: *5K to injury* — fragility, drift, and systemic failure
- Week 3: *Marathon mindset* — pacing, structure, and operational resilience

This whole process?
It’s not about how fast you can go.
It’s about how far the system can carry you.

🔦 Look at Me (Yes, Actually)I’m not the kind of person who shouts “expert” from the rooftops.
Usually, I’d rather keep building than post about it.

But let’s be honest:

- I’ve spent the past **three weeks coding side-by-side with AI**, day and night
- I’ve burned **two prototypes to the ground**
- I’ve rebuilt one from scratch with a working **manual RCA, prompt logging, and review system**
- I’m now tracking **conventions, drift, and replays** with the discipline of an SRE but applied to prompt engineering
- I’ve validated this approach **against the current frontier of AI coding practices**
- And I’m actively shaping it into a **repeatable, enforceable, teachable system**

So yeah—**this is me calling it out.**
Not because I think I’ve “arrived.”
But because I’m *doing the work* and naming the patterns as I go.

If that makes me an expert-in-progress on AI‑Ops, so be it.
If nothing else, I’m someone with a few battle scars, a lot of documentation, and the humility to know that week four might still punch me in the face.

But now?
At least I’ll log it.

            **What is AI‑Ops?**

A deliberate engineering discipline for AI-assisted software development, where prompt-generated code is versioned, reviewed, audited, and governed like any other operational system.

**What is SRE in this context?**

SRE = Site Reliability Engineering — a practice from Google that focuses on system reliability, incident response, and automation. I apply SRE principles to prompt workflows:

**Why this matters:**

This isn’t about speed. It’s about **durability**.
The AI can help build faster than ever — but *only if* we treat the system around it with the same discipline we apply to production infrastructure.

**Enterprise echoes:**
*Mailchimp’s adoption of vibe coding produced measurable speed gains—but only once guardrails were layered in. That mirrors my own teardown and rebuild strategy—with prompt-level governance from day one.* ([VENTURE BEAT](https://venturebeat.com/ai/hard-won-vibe-coding-insights-mailchimps-40-speed-gain-came-with-governance-price/))
