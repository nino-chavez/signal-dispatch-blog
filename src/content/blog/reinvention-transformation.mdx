excerpt: "Most reorgs I’ve seen are just corporate feng shui — shift a few boxes, rename a few titles, pretend it’s visionary. But this one? This one actually maps to something real. For once, the language isn’t just for clients — it mirrors what I’ve been doing in my own damn operating system."

A few days ago, Accenture announced it’s reorganizing (again). Starting this fall, what used to be five separate business units—Strategy, Consulting, Song, Technology, Operations—will collapse into one: **Reinvention Services**.

Now, I’ve seen a lot of reorgs at Accenture.
Usually, they read like what they are: **lipstick on a pig.**
We reshuffle boxes, rename some things, write a few memos about being “positioned for growth,” and hope no one notices the strategy hasn’t really changed. It’s part of the rhythm—every few financial cycles, we stir the pot.

But this one? This one actually hit.

**Not because it’s perfect.**
But because—for once—it mirrors something I’ve been living.

**From transformation to reinvention**

“Digital transformation” had a good run. It let us sell shiny tools to legacy orgs, slap automation on broken processes, and call it a win. We used it like a magic word—flexible enough to sell, vague enough not to threaten.

But AI is different. It doesn’t just accelerate the old game.
It breaks the board.

Reinvention isn’t about optimization. It’s about rupture.
Not layering new tech on top, but shedding skin.
Not change for the sake of motion, but recomposing your whole posture around new physics.

That’s what I’ve been feeling these past few weeks.
Not a pivot. A reassembly.

**What this looks like (for me):**

Using AI daily didn’t just change my work—it changed *me*.
My language. My voice. My posture in a room.

I started noticing where I was still speaking consultant. Still packaging myself in legacy language—“strategy,” “enablement,” “solutions.” But inside, I was already operating with a new internal stack:

- Less “here’s the answer,” more “here’s the signal.”
- Less expert mode, more builder-in-motion.
- Less performance, more precise, structured reflection.

It’s hard to describe without sounding self-helpy. But the shift is real.
I’m putting a new name and frame to how I think, speak, and lead.

Not reinventing the brand.
Reinventing the *baseline*.

**Accenture merged five divisions to scale this shift.**
I merged five versions of myself:

The consultant.
The creative.
The technologist.
The brand builder.
The writer.

They used to sit in different corners of my week. Now they move as one system.
That’s what reinvention feels like. Not clean. But coherent.

**No takedown here. Just recognition.**
Yes, part of me still reads this reorg as a narrative play.
But another part of me sees it for what it might be:
A real attempt to name what’s actually happening—inside and out.

And I relate to that.
Not because I drank the Kool-Aid.
But because for once, the language *matches the feeling*.

This post is just a field note. A breadcrumb.
But if you’re also sensing the shift—from expertise to integration, from performance to posture—I’m right here with you.

We’re not transforming anymore.
We’re becoming.

*Obvious but necessary:* These views are entirely my own. They don’t reflect the official position, strategy, or vibes of my employer. Just a snapshot from one node inside the system, working it out in real time.
