I just shipped a complex React application. It’s data-driven, theme-aware, and type-safe. It runs cleanly in strict mode and was built to scale.

And I still don’t really know how JSX works. Not the way a traditional frontend dev does. I couldn’t walk you through the Babel transform pipeline. I don’t have the self-closing tag rules memorized. Honestly, I didn’t write most of the boilerplate anyway—my AI assistant did.

At first, I wondered: *Should I feel like a fraud?*

I don’t think so. Because my job wasn’t to master syntax.

It was to design the system.

**You’re Not Here to Memorize—You’re Here to Design**I may not know JSX deeply. But I *do* understand:

- **What this app is supposed to do**—its purpose, boundaries, and interfaces.
- **What makes it maintainable**—composition, abstraction, and state discipline.
- **What guardrails are needed**—how to encode constraints in TypeScript.
- **What ‘wrong’ looks like**—when the AI gives me code that’s technically fine but architecturally brittle.

That’s not classic frontend expertise. That’s systems thinking. My value wasn’t in the keystrokes—I brought the map.

**The Lead Architect Mindset**This feels familiar. In enterprise work, the lead architect rarely:

- Hand-writes every query.
- Authors every test.
- Stays fluent in every YAML schema.

Instead, they:

- Define the principles.
- Enforce the constraints.
- Interrogate the output.

Same here. When building with AI, I’m still doing the architect’s job—just in a compressed loop between me and my assistant.

The AI is fast, capable, and obedient. But it needs direction. It needs *me* to notice when a proposed solution will scale—and when it’ll rot in two sprints.

**AI Isn’t Replacing Engineers—It’s Replacing the Dev Team**Software used to be a team sport. Architect, developer, reviewer, QA, DevOps.

Now? I’m often solo with a fast-reacting partner in the loop. But I’m still doing all those jobs—just abstracted up a level.

- I am the **Architect**, defining the patterns and guardrails.
- I am the **Lead Dev**, delegating tactical work to the AI.
- I am the **Reviewer**, catching brittle code before it spreads.
- I am the **QA**, directing validation tests and edge case coverage.

I don’t need to know everything. I need to know how to lead the team—even if it’s just me and a machine.

**The Wrong Question Is “Do I Know Enough?”**If you’re building with AI and wondering:
*“Am I a real engineer if I don’t know what’s happening under the hood?”*

That’s not the right question.

Ask instead:

1. **“Did I define the ‘why’ clearly?”**
(Can the assistant follow my intent without hallucinating?)
2. **“Did I audit the ‘how’ wisely?”**
(Can I detect when the code works, but the design is off?)
3. **“Does this solution compound or collapse over time?”**
(Am I building leverage, or layering fragility?)

If you can answer *those* questions, you're already doing the real job. You’re not memorizing syntax. You’re steering systems.

And that’s the only expertise that matters now.
