“Docs as code” has always been about treating documentation like a first-class citizen — versioning it alongside the software, keeping it close to the codebase, and using automation to maintain consistency.

But with AI-assisted coding, documentation can become something much more powerful: a **knowledge layer for both humans and machines.**

When I built our **Enhanced Role Management System**, the *Implementation Plan* laid out a multi-week rollout: database migrations, RLS policies, front-end updates, and a full user management interface. Normally, this would take multiple sprints of back-and-forth between developers, testers, and product leads.

Now, with structured, AI-ready docs, I can cut that time from **weeks to hours** by leveraging what I call my **“AI engineering team”** — a multi-LLM workflow that treats documentation as the single source of truth for planning, building, and testing.

* * *

### 1\. From Documentation to Living Specs

Traditional documentation is descriptive. Docs as Code 2.0 is **prescriptive** — it defines not just *what was built* but *what to build next and how AI should build it.*

For the Enhanced Roles feature, I wrote **four key documents** that function as living specs:

-   role-system-implementation-plan.md — Architecture, database schema, RLS policies, and edge functions.
    
-   role-system-developer-guide.md — Type definitions, permission logic, and capability mapping.
    
-   role-system-user-guide.md — Plain-language explanation of roles for admins, players, and coaches.
    
-   user-management-interface-design.md — UI mockups, workflows, and component specs.
    

These documents are **version-controlled alongside the code**, meaning every commit not only changes the system but updates the shared blueprint that both humans and AI agents can reference.

* * *

### Callout Example: Capability Matrix

From role-system-developer-guide.md:

This isn’t just for developers. It’s also **promptable context for LLMs** — enabling AI to generate role-based UI elements, SQL checks, or tests with accuracy.

* * *

### 2\. The Original Timeline: Weeks of Work

The **Implementation Plan** was structured as a phased rollout:

This roadmap made sense for a traditional team. But now that the **docs themselves define the schema, UI, and tests**, I can accelerate this timeline dramatically.

* * *

### 3\. My AI Engineering Team Concept

In a previous article, I described how I treat multiple LLMs as a **virtual engineering team**:

-   **Planner LLM:** Validates the architecture, identifies gaps, and checks for edge cases.
    
-   **Builder LLM:** Generates SQL migrations, React components, and API endpoints based on the docs.
    
-   **Tester LLM:** Cross-references the Developer Guide to create automated tests and ensure compliance with role definitions.
    

The **Enhanced Roles docs** are the *knowledge base* for this team. By feeding them into my LLM stack, I can have:

-   **RLS policies generated in minutes** (instead of hand-written over days).
    
-   **Admin dashboard components scaffolded** directly from the user-management-interface-design.md mockups.
    
-   **Unit tests auto-generated** from the ROLE\_CAPABILITIES table, covering all permission scenarios.
    

* * *

### Callout Example: RLS Policies

From role-system-implementation-plan.md:

This block doesn’t just explain access rules — it’s **input for LLM-based generation of additional policies**, or test cases like:

> *“Ensure a* viewer role cannot update any record in team\_memberships.”

* * *

### 4\. From Weeks to Hours

With these AI-ready docs:

-   **SQL migrations:** Generated in a single pass using the schema and RLS guidelines.
    
-   **React components:** Built from the mockups in user-management-interface-design.md, which includes detailed UI layouts and role-based logic.
    
-   **Testing:** Unit and integration tests scaffolded automatically based on documented capabilities.
    

A feature that was scoped as **14 weeks of human development time** can now be **bootstrapped in hours**, leaving me to focus on **edge cases, business logic, and review.**

* * *

### 5\. Real-World Example: UI Scaffolding

From user-management-interface-design.md:

Instead of handing AI a vague prompt like *“build a user management page,”* I pass this **design spec**. The result: accurate, production-ready scaffolds on the first try.

* * *

### 6\. Practical Takeaways for AI-Driven Teams

If you’re exploring AI coding in your workflow:

1.  **Write feature-specific docs like code:** Implementation plans, dev guides, and UI specs should be structured and explicit.
    
2.  **Version everything:** Store these docs in Git alongside your codebase for history and traceability.
    
3.  **Treat AI as a collaborator:** Use multiple LLMs to draft, cross-review, and refine specs before coding begins.
    
4.  **Feed AI the docs as context:** Let the AI pull from your implementation plans, rather than guessing.
    
5.  **Derive tests from your docs:** Capability matrices and role definitions are perfect for automated test generation.

### 7\. Closing Thought

**Docs as Code 2.0** isn’t just about writing better documentation. It’s about building **AI-ready knowledge layers** that allow you to compress **weeks of engineering effort into hours** — without losing clarity, quality, or control.

The more structured and complete your docs are, the more effectively your human and AI teams can collaborate on building the next version of your system.
