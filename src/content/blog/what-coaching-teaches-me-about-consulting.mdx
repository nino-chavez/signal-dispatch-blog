I coach **club volleyball** and lead technology consulting projects for global brands. On paper, those might seem like two very different roles. But the longer I do both, the more I realize they run on the same engine:
**Clarity. Trust. Growth.**

Here’s what coaching keeps teaching me about consulting—and how the court keeps sharpening my instincts in the boardroom.

1. **You can’t fake clarity**Players know when your system is vague. So do clients. If the roles, expectations, and goals aren’t clear, chaos fills the gaps. Coaching club has made me ruthless about defining structure—where we’re going, what success looks like, and who owns what. That muscle translates directly to consulting work: define the game, then play it with intent.

2. **Trust beats tactics**In club, athletes (and parents) come with different motivations—some want college exposure, some just want high-level reps. No single drill or message works for all of them. Same with clients: there’s no one-size-fits-all playbook. But if they trust you, they’ll follow you. That means listening well, adapting your delivery, and earning belief over time. Tactics matter—but trust makes them land.

3. **Expectations are everything**Club coaching means managing a full spectrum of expectations—players, parents, coaches, directors. Consulting’s no different—stakeholders, sponsors, delivery teams, end users. Each group sees the game through a different lens. The key in both? Aligning those perspectives without watering down the goal. That’s what leadership is: creating shared direction across different voices, all aiming at the same net.

4. **Different personalities, shared goals**I’ve coached quiet grinders, loud leaders, and everything in between. I’ve consulted with clients who needed hand-holding and others who needed to be reined in. You can’t treat everyone the same—but you can hold everyone to the same standard. Coaching taught me how to flex my approach without lowering the bar. That’s a core leadership skill in any domain.

5. **Growth isn’t always linear**In both coaching and consulting, progress doesn’t always look like progress. Sometimes a player struggles with a new role before they break through. Sometimes a project gets messier before it gets clearer. Coaching taught me to zoom out—recognize the season, not just the sprint. That perspective helps me guide clients through ambiguity with patience and steadiness.

6. **Energy is contagious**As a coach, your tone sets the gym. As a consultant, your presence sets the room. Whether I’m on a sideline or in a strategy session, I’ve learned to show up calm, focused, and prepared—because that’s what creates space for others to rise.

7. **People remember how you made them feel**Years from now, my players won’t remember every score. But they’ll remember if they felt seen, supported, and challenged. Clients are the same. Delivering solutions matters—but so does how you make people feel along the way. That’s the part that sticks.

**Bottom line:**
Coaching has made me a better consultant. Consulting has made me a better coach.
Both roles require the same quiet skill: **help people grow—without doing the work for them.**
Set the vision. Build the system. Hold the standard. And earn the trust to lead from beside, not above.
