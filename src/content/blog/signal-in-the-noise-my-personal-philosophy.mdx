I’ve never been interested in being the loudest person in the room.
I’m more interested in noticing the thing nobody else is watching—and using it to move the whole system forward.

That’s how I lead. That’s how I build. And that’s how I show up in life.

At the core of how I operate is a simple idea:
**In any situation, there’s a lot of noise—but there’s always a signal.**

The signal is what actually matters.
It’s what’s true. It’s what’s durable.
It’s what cuts through panic, ego, and performance.

My job is to find it, trust it, and act from it.

What I Value (And How That Shows Up)🔍 Clarity over chaosI don’t add to the noise just to be heard. I stay quiet until I have something useful to say—and when I do, I make it count.

🤝 Earned trust over assumed authorityI don’t expect people to follow me because of my title. I earn it by how I show up—especially under pressure.

🛠️ Progress over perfectionI move with urgency, but not recklessness. I believe in starting early, adjusting often, and finishing strong.

🧭 Presence over performanceI’m not here to perform leadership. I’m here to lead. That means doing the small, unglamorous things that actually help people move forward.

What That Looks Like in Real Life- I take the call no one wants when a project’s on fire.
- I’m the calm voice in a room full of escalation.
- I notice the person who’s struggling before they ask for help.
- I’ll shoot the photo that hits harder than any highlight reel—because it *felt* like the moment.

None of that shows up on a resume. But it’s the stuff that earns trust over time.

I’m Not Here to Prove AnythingI don’t need to win arguments.
I don’t need to be right all the time.
I don’t need to impress anyone with how much I know.

I need to show up, read the room, make good decisions, and leave people better off than when I found them.

That’s the through-line across everything I do—tech, media, leadership, family, coaching, photography.

**“Signal in the Noise” isn’t a motto. It’s how I move through the world.**
Quietly. Precisely. With intent.
I don’t need credit. I need clarity.

That’s what I look for. That’s what I try to create.
And that’s what drives me—everywhere I go.
