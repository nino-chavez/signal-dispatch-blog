Most of what you hear about AI in consulting is slideware. People love talking about the potential. But day to day? The work still has to get done.

Here’s how I actually use AI—right now—in real strategy, delivery, and leadership.

I don’t delegate the thinking. I use AI to get to clarity faster:

- It’s my pattern spotter when I’m reviewing client decks or delivery plans.
- It drafts internal frameworks based on fragments I feed it.
- It mocks up org charts, playbooks, emails, or POVs so I’m not starting from zero.
- And when I’m mentoring younger talent, it helps me structure their development plans without recreating the wheel every time.

I treat it like a high-context analyst who never gets tired.

The real value isn’t in the polish—it’s in the **reduction of drag**. I move faster, with fewer tabs open in my brain. That’s the game.

A few principles I follow:

- **Don’t overprompt.** Talk to it like a teammate, not a robot.
- **Build memory.** I feed it past materials so it starts thinking like I do.
- **Stay in control.** I don’t copy-paste final outputs. I refine. Always.

Could I get similar results without it? Sure. But it’d cost more energy, more time, and more willpower than most days allow.

The real unlock isn’t using AI to think *for* you. It’s using it to think *with* you—at speed.

If you're still waiting for a killer use case, you're missing the point.
The point is velocity.
