Remember when every new phone or laptop felt like a massive leap? That feeling is gone. Moore’s Law - the promise of doubling chip power every two years - is running out of steam.

The easy hardware wins are behind us. Progress is shifting into new territory:

**Near-term (coming soon):**

-   **AI as infrastructure.** Less about novelty apps, more like electricity — powering software that writes and debugs itself.
    
-   **Energy upgrades.** Better batteries, smarter grids, and small reactors to meet AI’s hunger for power.
    
-   **Trust layers.** Provenance, watermarks, governance so we can trust what AI generates.
    

**Middle horizon (in your lifetime):**

-   **Human-computer interfaces.** AR for surgeons and engineers, advanced prosthetics, even brain-computer links.
    
-   **Autonomous logistics.** Supply chains, fleets, and warehouses run by agents optimizing in real time.
    

**Long bets (decades out):**

-   **New computing models.** Quantum and photonics — leaps that would make today’s supercomputers look like calculators.
    
-   **Biotech at scale.** CRISPR therapies as routine medicine, lab-grown food that tastes right and scales.
    

The orchard isn’t empty. The low-hanging fruit is gone, but higher up are breakthroughs that will reset the entire landscape.
