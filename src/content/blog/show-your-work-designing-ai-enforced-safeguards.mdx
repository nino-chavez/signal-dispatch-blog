This isn‚Äôt magic. It‚Äôs thoughtful infrastructure.

After a few bugs slipped past my AI assistant, I paused and asked:

> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got docs, scripts, and checks‚Ä¶ but which ones do *I* have to remember? Which ones does *AI* already know to run? And how many are just silently tucked into other commands?‚Äù

That turned into a real system redesign.

* * *

‚ö†Ô∏è **CURRENT STATE**

149+ scattered NPM scripts. 4 inconsistent entry points:

-   Manual commands (npm run pre-deploy, etc.)
    
-   AI-invoked checks (‚ÄúRun the CORS validator‚Äù)
    
-   Auto-enforced (lint-staged, pre-commit)
    
-   Hidden triggers (nested pre-\* scripts)
    

Unclear boundaries. Easy to forget. Drift waiting to happen.

* * *

‚úÖ **UNIFIED SAFEGUARD SYSTEM (NOW LIVE)**

> One entry point: npm run safeguard --ai-mode

-   Detects what kind of task is running
    
-   Runs only relevant safeguards (risk-based logic)
    
-   Outputs structured results for AI or human review
    
-   Auto-fixes common issues
    
-   Stops the task if needed ‚Äî or continues cleanly
    

We also added --verify for post-task enforcement.

* * *

üõ†Ô∏è **MY REAL AI WORKFLOW (NO FLUFF)**

Every feature starts like this:

1.  npm run safeguard --ai-mode
    
2.  AI decides which checks apply
    
3.  If broken ‚Üí auto-fix or explain
    
4.  If clean ‚Üí proceed with implementation
    
5.  After completion ‚Üí --verify to confirm
    

Not a hypothetical. Not a vibes-based system. This runs in production.

This is part of a bigger shift I‚Äôm chasing: **from AI assistance to AI enforcement.** Real safety nets. Real repeatability. So I can move faster *without* racking up tech debt.
