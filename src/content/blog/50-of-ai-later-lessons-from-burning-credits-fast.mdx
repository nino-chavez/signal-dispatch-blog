> *Building with AI is cheap—until it isn’t. Here’s what burned, what I learned, and how I’m budgeting the next sprint.*

## 1. The Prototype Price Tag (or: How to Torch Cash Fast)

I set out to build a clean **volleyball‑tournament schedule viewer**—transforming raw JSON scraped from the event site into a real‑time grid UI. I plopped down my first **$25** batch of lovable.dev credits thinking the assistant would rocket me from sketch to production. The credits vanished on rapid‑fire prototyping. The **next $25** went to "production hardening" refactors that only generated new tech‑debt tangles.

**Takeaway:** Credits aren’t money—they’re mental Monopoly money. Burn fast enough, and every fuzzy assumption hiding in your spec gets lit up like neon.

## 2. Why Credits Vanish So Quickly

- **Illusion of Instant Speed.** The model prints code in seconds, so you assume the project timeline shrinks the same way. It doesn't.
- **Prompt‑as‑Code Rot.** Each change cascades like version drift in a repo no one’s merging—every new prompt slightly diverges from previous intent, causing subtle but compounding inconsistencies. Each change cascades like version drift in a repo no one’s merging.
- **Context Window Amnesia.** Context windows expire; you end up re‑explaining architecture instead of extending it.

> *AI saves typing, but it doesn't save you from yourself.*

## 3. The One‑Person Discipline Stack

Because this was a solo side-project (aka me, my coffee, and some questionable life choices), there was no specialist bench—just me and a credit meter ticking upward. During the rewrite I had to swap hats faster than a pit crew:

| Hat | Core Concern |
| --- | --- |
| Data Architect | Normalizing import feeds, naming conventions |
| Software Architect | Module boundaries, service contracts |
| Security Architect | AuthZ splits for public vs. admin |
| Performance Engineer | Pre‑parsed data for faster UI paint |
| UI/UX Designer | Navigation hierarchy, state cues |
| Business Analyst | Gherkin‑style acceptance criteria |

AI helped execute slices of each hat, but **only after** I articulated the discipline‑specific intent. That articulation is the hidden cost.

## 4. From "Make It Work" to "Describe It So It Works"

Writing prompts that survive multiple build cycles felt like learning a stricter programming language—one that's picky, moody, and incredibly vague about its errors (like my first boss).

**Pattern that finally worked:**

1. *Scenario* – single‑sentence business outcome.
2. *Gherkin* – Given/When/Then for each user story.
3. *Architectural note* – constraints, dependencies, NFRs.
4. *Success snapshot* – expected JSON payload or UI state.

Feed that quartet, and the AI stops hallucinating edge cases.

*Concrete misfire:* A dropdown for court filters suddenly went blank. Thirty prompts earlier we’d **asked** the AI to hide options with no matching data; when I later flagged “nothing’s showing,” the model assumed it was a bug and silently ripped out the very feature we’d added. The prompt, not the code, was the defect.

## 5. Budgeting the Build Cycle

A quick canvas I'm using for the next round:

| Sprint | Goal | Credits | Human Hours | Deliverable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Architecture spike | 10 | 3 | ERD + service diagram |
| 1 | CRUD MVP | 15 | 6 | Working data flow |
| 2 | Auth & roles | 10 | 4 | Public/Admin split |
| 3 | Perf hardening | 10 | 4 | Cached queries + tests |

**Rule of thumb (back‑of‑napkin):** Over $50 in spend I averaged **20–30 usable lines of code per credit** once prompts were airtight. Your mileage—and model—will vary, so budget in ranges, not absolutes.

## 6. Designing for AI Collaboration

- **Normalize early.** Up‑front schema clarity kills downstream prompt bloat.
- **Name states, not screens.** AI can wireframe if you describe *why* the state exists.
- **Lock vocab.** A single glossary entry beats 50 context reminders.
- **Version prompts.** Treat them like code—diff, review, branch, merge.

### 6a. Fresh‑Start Blueprint: Turning Lessons into Architecture

After stepping back from the prototype rubble, I drafted a **green‑field schema** and phased plan that bakes every lesson into the foundation.

**Normalized Core Tables (7)**

| Table | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| tournaments | Top‑level container (replaces events) |
| courts | Parsed court names linked to tournaments |
| divisions | Division names/codes per tournament |
| clubs | Club catalog per tournament |
| teams | Child of clubs; cached full_name for search |
| work_teams | Officiating teams (replaces officials) |
| matches | Foreign‑key hub with sort_key for fast ordering |

*Key benefits:* venue complexity dropped, work‑team search enabled, club filters become single JOINs.

**Import Workflow Highlights**

1. Parse "Club – Team" strings → create/link club & team.
2. Extract courts/divisions/work teams.
3. Store IDs in `matches`, pre‑compute `sort_key`.
4. **Upsert on re‑import** – ensure repeated JSON loads *update* existing records instead of duplicating them, keeping the database idempotent.

**Four‑Phase Implementation**

1. **Schema migration** – drop, create, index, types regen.
2. **Enhanced import** – rewrite JSON parser, normalize on ingest.
3. **Clean React foundation** – scrap bloated components, query by FKs.
4. **Core feature pass** – tournament CRUD, schedule grid, club/work‑team filters.

> *The rewrite isn’t extra work—it’s paying off the tuition from the first $50.*

## 7. Mindset Shift – Developer to System Choreographer

The work isn't key‑pushing pixels; it's:

- Negotiating constraints between roles that all live in your head.
- Translating business nuance into deterministic instructions.
- Spot-checking AI output like a slightly paranoid auditor—because trusting AI blindly is how you end up debugging at 3 AM (trust me on this one)., not a pair‑programmer.

If that sounds like **Business Architect meets Dev Lead**, welcome to 2025. (See also my *AI‑as‑Infrastructure* and *Quiet Leadership* essays for the broader leadership context.)

## 8. Recommendations

1. **Price the learning curve.** Assume 25–50% of first‑month credits are tuition.
2. **Sprint‑gate on architecture.** No feature sprints until schema + auth are locked.
3. **Write prompts like contracts.** If a junior dev can’t implement it, the AI won’t either.
4. **Build rollback paths.** Keep manual checkpoints so a bad prompt doesn’t brick the branch.
5. **Budget by role, not feature.** Allocate credits/time to “Data integrity” the same way you would to “Landing page.”
6. **Instrument early.** Stand up basic monitoring/logging so performance regressions and runaway credit burns surface before they hurt.
7. **Track prompt versions in Git.** Commit each substantive prompt iteration alongside code so you can diff intent, revert misfires, and share reproducible context with collaborators.

## 9. Where This Leaves Us

AI tooling shifts cost from **labor** to **clarity**. You still pay; the invoice just arrives as credit burn and cognitive load.

I’ll run the next build with half the credits and double the upfront rigor. If it works, great. If not, at least the failure will be cheaper—and better documented.

*Field notes end. Where might your hidden tuition costs be? Feedback welcome.*
