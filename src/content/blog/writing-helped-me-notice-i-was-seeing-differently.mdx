This has been swirling in my head for a long time.

I’ve felt the shift. Noticed the subtle disconnects.
Recognized that I was reacting to things differently than I used to—or than people around me were.

But it wasn’t until I started writing—about entirely different things—that the swirl began to settle.
And only then could I *finally* put it into words.

I didn’t set out to write about this.
But somehow, writing made it possible to say out loud what I’ve been circling in my head for years.

It’s not that I suddenly realized I’d changed.
I’ve known for a while.

The change just never had language.
It lived in reactions. In micro-decisions. In the quiet sense that something had shifted in how I interpreted what I saw, heard, or felt.

And I couldn’t explain it. Not without sounding like I was being dramatic or overthinking.

But as I kept writing—about tools, process, leadership, clarity—I began to hear my own signal more clearly. And when I tuned into it, I realized:

I’ve been seeing differently for a long time.
I just didn’t know how to *talk about it*.

Writing gave the swirl a shape.
It helped me move from noticing to naming.

Not because this was the topic I set out to write.
But because clarity in one place makes space for clarity somewhere else.

And now that I can finally say it, I can start to examine it:
What happens when you quietly outgrow the way you used to see the world?
What does it mean when your perception shifts, but you’re still learning how to bring others with you?

This isn’t the end of that thought.
It’s just the first time I’ve said it out loud.

I didn’t think I was writing about identity at first—but that’s what it turned into. The more I reflected, the more I realized these shifts in how we see and speak are at the core of how we evolve. There’s more like this under [identity](/tag/identity/) if you’re following that thread.
