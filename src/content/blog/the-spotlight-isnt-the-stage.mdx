Some ideas feel so right, so clear, that we forget to look around.

A client came to us wanting to bring their outsourced commerce business back in-house. In their minds, the move was straightforward: build a storefront. That was the spotlight — the shiny part. The customer-facing piece they could see.

But the real work wasn’t in the build. It was in everything behind it:

- sourcing and fulfillment,
- data and org readiness,
- owning and operating the stack,
- orchestrating dozens of capabilities that had quietly been someone else’s problem.

They were trying to step into the spotlight without realizing they hadn’t built the stage.

> I can build you the fastest, flashiest car — but it’s useless if it sits in the garage with no one who knows how to drive it.

That’s not just a planning problem. It’s a **decision hygiene** problem.

**What Decision Hygiene Really Means**We glorify the big call: the moment the leader says *this is the way*.

But most bad outcomes don’t come from choosing wrong.
They come from **deciding dirty** — with fuzzy inputs, shallow framing, or pure gut-feel momentum.

**Decision hygiene** is how we resist that.
It’s a posture of slowing down to ask:

- Are we solving the right problem?
- What assumptions are we skipping past?
- What systems does this decision depend on?

Hygiene isn’t a framework. It’s a habit. A way of thinking before acting. Of widening the lens before locking in the move.

**The Strategy You See vs. The System You Need**Surface thinking is seductive.

A storefront *feels* like strategy. A deck *looks* like a plan. A pilot *seems* like traction.

But surface moves without structural thinking are like building stage lights without rigging the platform beneath. No one can perform on that.

Real strategy requires:

- clean inputs,
- clear ownership,
- invisible but essential architecture.

It asks leaders to see the whole system — not just the bright part.

**When Passion Blinds You**Good ideas get dangerous when they move too fast.

When conviction outpaces understanding.
When what’s exciting masks what’s missing.
When a visible win takes precedence over system readiness.

The challenge isn’t ambition — it’s **scope blindness**.

In commerce, that looks like:

- launching a new channel without fulfillment readiness,
- owning tech without owning operations,
- investing in features no one is prepared to run.

**Closing: From Spotlight to Stagecraft**If you lead strategy, the question isn’t: *Is this idea good?*
It’s: *Do we understand what it lives inside of?*

The spotlight matters. But if the stage isn’t built, lit, wired, and supported — nothing holds.

> Good decisions don’t just require vision. They require stagecraft.
