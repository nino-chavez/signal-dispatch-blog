**Post 3 of 5 in Muscle Memory**

I used to know my best friend’s phone number. I used to know directions without a GPS. I used to write longhand before I typed anything.

Now? I pause before spelling “rhythm.”

It’s not that I’m getting dumber. It’s that I stopped needing to remember. I offloaded all the friction.

But the friction is what built fluency. That hesitation now? It used to be instinct. I used to *know* things because I had to hold them. Now, I just swipe or ask.

And when you stop needing to remember, you stop learning to.
