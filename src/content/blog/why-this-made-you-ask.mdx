When I launched this blog, a friend called me—not to congratulate me, not to critique a post—but to ask a simple question:

**“What are you doing with this?”**

*This*, meaning the writing. Not my photos. Not the DJ mixes I’ve posted for years. Not the media work, or the behind-the-scenes reels, or the late-night edits. Just… writing.

It stuck with me.

Not because it was offensive. It wasn’t. It was honest. Curious. Maybe even to force me to think about taking it seriously (in case I wasn't).

But here’s what hit me: nobody ever asked what I was doing with my photography. Or what the point of my mixes was. Or what I was trying to say with a volleyball highlight reel.

**Writing, for some reason, felt like a line had been crossed.**

I’ve spent some time since then trying to figure out what made *this* different.

I think it’s the illusion of intimacy.

Photos feel like documentation. Music feels like taste. But writing? Writing feels like declaration.

Even if I’m just riffing. Even if I’m not trying to convince anyone of anything. The format itself carries weight. It’s the medium we associate with manifestos, with essays, with carefully chosen words that say *something* about who you are.

Ironically, it’s probably the least polished thing I publish.

When I’m behind the camera, I control the frame. When I post a mix, I’ve rehearsed it. But when I write? It’s messy. It’s closer to thought than product. You see the seams.

And that’s probably why it feels more exposed.

But here’s the punchline:

**It’s all the same.**

Writing is no different than hitting publish on a photo gallery. Or sharing a mix I recorded after midnight. Or posting a film edit I cut on instinct. It’s all the same urge:

> To create something. To share it.
> To see if it connects.

What made *this* feel different wasn’t the content. It was the perception. The assumption that writing = intent.

But I’m not writing to prove a point. I’m writing to find it.

And honestly, if you want to know what I’m doing with “this,” here’s the answer:

**I’m doing the same thing I’ve always done.**
Just using a different tool.
