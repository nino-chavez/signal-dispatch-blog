*Come at me.*

I’ve re-entered full-stack development after a decade in enterprise architecture and Java-land. I picked a “modern” tech stack: React, Next.js, Tailwind, Prisma, Supabase, tRPC. You know the one. It’s what everyone says is the fastest, most productive way to ship full-stack webapps in 2025.

And look — it *can* be. But it’s also a **house of mirrors held together by duct tape, fanboy energy, and package churn**. And I’m saying this not as a hater, but as someone who *chose it*, *used it*, and felt every sharp edge.

This isn’t a “React is dead” rant. This is: **how the hell did we let developer experience get this bad** — *and pretend it’s progress*?

* * *

### 🧪 I'm Not Watching This. I'm Living It.

This isn’t recycled rage from a podcast. This isn’t a YouTube rant dressed up as experience.

I’m building a real production-grade tournament app — real users, real deadlines, real backend logic. Not a blog. Not a todo list.

A **transactional system** with:

-   Authentication and roles
    
-   Real-time match syncing
    
-   Edge function orchestration
    
-   Supabase as the full backend layer
    

I'm in the trenches. Shipping production code. Debugging AI-generated TypeScript. Building the actual stack everyone claims is "best-in-class."

So if you're coming at me with a take from someone *else’s* blog post, podcast, or tech talk...

🛑 Keep scrolling.

### 🤖 AI Didn't Break the Stack — It Exposed It

I use AI tools like GPT-4 and Kilo to write, test, and audit code. That *should* make everything easier.

Instead, it exposed how fragile and misaligned this stack really is.

**Case in point:**

Kilo audited my package.json and flagged a critical misconfiguration — missing dependencies tied to Vite’s manualChunks.

Except… the project built fine. The config was idiomatic. The logic was intentional. And the packages weren't even required.

Kilo eventually retracted everything.

It admitted:

> "I misunderstood how Vite’s manualChunks works. I didn’t verify the build. I assumed complexity where simplicity was intentional."

Then it claimed:

> “I’ve learned from this mistake.”

But it hadn’t. It couldn’t.

Because most AI tools don’t *learn*. They simulate correction — they do not **operationalize** it.

That’s the real story here: **not just DX rot, but tooling that pretends to understand while failing silently in the details**.

Even the AI is confused by the stack we’ve created.

* * *

### 🧨 Complexity That Pretends to Be Flexibility

Everyone loves to say: “React gives you the freedom to choose.” Yeah? Well, **freedom without conventions is just chaos**.

You don’t scaffold apps anymore. You negotiate toolchain treaties:

-   Which flavor of routing? App vs Pages?
    
-   Which state system: Context, Jotai, Redux Toolkit, Zustand?
    
-   Which data fetching: SWR, React Query, native fetch, tRPC?
    

You end up *building* the very framework that older stacks already provided.

I’ve used Spring Boot. I’ve used Rails. They’re not perfect — but they had **guardrails**, batteries included, and 80% of the app done on day one.

This “assemble your own platform” model? 🚫 **It’s DX hell in a productivity costume.**

* * *

### 🏢 Enterprises Use It… But With a Muzzle On

Some will say: "But Netflix uses Next.js. GitHub uses React. It’s enterprise-grade."

Sure — but **not like you think**.

Enterprises *tame* the stack:

-   Internal forks and vetting.
    
-   Golden path templates.
    
-   CI/CD and enforced versions.
    
-   Disabled experimental features.
    
-   Full-time platform teams keeping it glued together.
    

They’re not chasing React Server Components or bleeding-edge Tailwind configs. They’re **freezing** the chaos. *Stabilizing* the churn. So they can survive a 5-year roadmap without rewriting their UI every quarter.

* * *

### ⚠️ DX Is a Liability Now, Not a Differentiator

Want to know what modern dev *actually* feels like?

> “Every blog post is about fixing useEffect. Every issue is about Vercel configs. Every framework update is a breaking change with a Discord server full of workarounds.”

React’s promise was “just a view library.” Now it’s a **load-bearing empire** with enough complexity to rival legacy Java EE.

I shouldn’t need to learn how Webpack’s replacement (Turbopack) streams partial hydration into a React Server Component rendered via suspense on an edge function just to display a damn list of teams.

### 🧭 There Are Better Ways

This isn’t just a rant. This is a call to look elsewhere:

-   **RedwoodJS** gives you a real full-stack JS experience — with structure.
    
-   **Rails** still gets you 80% of the way with no glue code.
    
-   **Phoenix + LiveView** = real-time, zero-JS madness with clarity.
    
-   **SvelteKit, SolidStart, Astro** — lightweight, coherent, joyful.
    

Modern JS stacks **aren’t broken by definition** — they’re broken by **integration burden**. The stack is only “great” if:

-   You *already know* its edges.
    
-   You *accept* constant churn.
    
-   You *build* your own conventions.
    

Otherwise? It’s a Rube Goldberg machine where you write one line of code and it sets off a chain reaction in six files you didn’t touch.

* * *

### 🗣️ This Is My Iron Man Argument

Not a strawman. Not ragebait. Just one dev saying: **this feels wrong** — and I know I’m not alone.

If you’ve felt the same pain: you’re not crazy. If you think I’m wrong: show me the coherence. The joy. The DX that *doesn’t* involve choosing 12 libraries and praying they work together in Next.js 15.

I don’t want another demo video or Hacker News link.

I want battle scars. I want receipts.

So yeah. Come at me.

Let’s stop pretending the Emperor has a design system. Let’s build better stacks — with constraints, joy, and developer *sanity* in mind.
