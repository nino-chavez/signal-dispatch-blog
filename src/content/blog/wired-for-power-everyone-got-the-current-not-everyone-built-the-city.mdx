This is Post 2 of 4 in the **Grid-Level Thinking** series.
Catch up on the full series [*here*](/tag/grid-level-thinking/)*.*

At this point, everyone’s got access.
Same APIs. Same models. Same tools.

This isn’t 2022. You’re not early.
Typing something into ChatGPT isn’t a strategy. It’s table stakes.

That’s the floor now. Not the ceiling.

We’re all on the grid.
But most people are just flipping light switches.
No one’s rewiring the building.

Just because the current’s flowing doesn’t mean you’ve built anything worth turning on.

Having power isn’t leverage.
**Using it well is.**

That’s the difference.

AI isn’t rare anymore.
Good design is.
Clear thinking is.
People who can adapt systems—who can rethink workflows with intent—are still rare.

That’s who I’m writing this for.
