**Opening**Everyone is busy selling shovels. But the mine moved. Agents now sell on surfaces brands do not own. The win is not a better shovel. It is eyes and throttle on those agents: traces, attribution, consent, limits.

Keep the shovels. Buy time. But take the high ground. Own traces, identity, and rate limits for agents brands do not control.

AEO and GEO help. Without telemetry and control, you cannot prove inclusion, rank, or reason.

**Abstract**Discovery and checkout are moving into agent surfaces. Tags do not fire. Legacy analytics fail. AEO and GEO help with ranking, but not with truth. This paper lays out a simple plan to restore signal. Build synthetic panels. Build a consented panel. Add server side exposure and receipt logs. Ship an owned agent with a small syndication kit. Align on a basic schema and a broker. Price on activity, not seats.

**Executive Summary**- Pixels fail inside agent flows. No browser. No tag fire.
- Brands lose inclusion, rank, framing, and clean attribution.
- AEO and GEO are short term levers. Measurement is the core job.
- The fix: panels, fingerprints, exposure logs, receipt logs.
- Add an owned agent and a light syndication kit.
- Use a shared schema, signed payloads, and a neutral broker.
- Fund telemetry, evals, and policy that can be enforced.
- Tie pricing to actions and risk. Not seat counts.
⸻

**1) What breaks in agent commerce****Presentation layer.** No visibility into what was shown.

**Competitive context.** No view of the full candidate set.

**Journey signals.** Impressions and paths disappear.

**Attribution.** Checkouts happen off site. Referrers die.

**Behavioral nuance.** Query phrasing and rewrites go dark.

**Copy integrity.** Claims get rewritten. Tone shifts.

**Pricing frame.** Value position is unclear.

**Bias drift.** Ranking changes without notice.

The result is simple. No observability. No leverage.
⸻

**2) Why pixels fail**Pixels need a renderer. Agents synthesize. Content is read, not rendered. HTML is stripped. Images get regenerated. No request hits a tracking server. Old tools do not survive the hop.
⸻

**3) What to measure**- Inclusion rate across target query sets.
- Rank share across those inclusions.
- Share of selection versus the candidate set.
- Copy integrity versus canonical facts.
- Price position versus peers.
- Bias drift by agent, region, and persona.
- Latency to cart. Resolution rate for service tasks.

These metrics restore control. They are enough to steer spend and strategy.
⸻

**4) Solution overview**Five parts. Built in order. Kept small.

1. **Synthetic shopper panels.**
2. Scripted agents and headless browsers probe third party agents. They capture ranked lists, prices, summaries, and layouts. Fast and cheap. Limited personalization.
3. **Consented human panels.**
4. A browser extension or mobile SDK records exposures on agent surfaces. Narrow scope. No PII. Real behavior. Slower to scale.
5. **Agent collaboration APIs.**
6. Server to server exposure logs and checkout receipts. Signed. Joined by session or fingerprint. Cleanest attribution.
7. **Owned agent with syndication.**
8. An onsite agent that returns offers and facts with reasons. A small API that third party agents can call. Observability by default.
9. **Standards and a broker.**
10. A simple schema, keys, and audits. A neutral layer that verifies, normalizes, and shares.
11. A simple schema, keys, and audits. A neutral layer that verifies, normalizes, and shares.

      [E] Panels and Drift Monitor

```

- **A.** Agent emits ranked candidate sets with reasons.
- **B.** Broker verifies signatures and schema.
- **C.** Agent or merchant emits order receipts.
- **D.** Feeds carry stable IDs and provenance.
- **E.** Panels audit and alert daily.
⸻

**6) Feed telemetry and fingerprints**Data must identify itself after a rewrite.

- Deterministic IDs:feed_sku_hash,content_fingerprint_seed.
- JSON-LD facts: specs, materials, claims, care.
- Image provenance: C2PA where possible.
- Phrase sets: stable attribute phrases for drift checks.

**Example**

```json
{
  "sku": "SKU-ALPHA",
  "brand": "BrandA",
  "title": "Pegasus 40",
  "attrs": { "drop_mm": 10, "category": "road", "gender": "unisex" },
  "feed_sku_hash": "fsh_a1b2c3",
  "content_fingerprint_seed": "cfs_0x938",
  "provenance": { "source": "source_system", "brand_id": "nike" },
  "facts_jsonld": {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Product",
    "gtin": "0012345678905",
    "material": "engineered mesh",
    "heelToToeDrop": "10 mm"
  }
}

```

⸻

**7) Exposure API****Auth.** Agent signed JWT. JWS checks required.

**Verb.** POST/v1/agent-exposures

**Payload**

```json
{
  "exposure_id": "x_9Jc8",
  "agent_id": "agent.acme",
  "session_id": "s_7bk",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T13:05:11Z",
  "persona": "value_seeker_us",
  "query": {
    "raw": "best running shoes under $150",
    "normalized": "running shoes <150",
    "intent": "compare_and_buy"
  },
  "candidate_set": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "content_fingerprint": "cfp_4a2",
      "provenance": {
        "brand": "BrandA",
        "merchant": "MerchantA",
        "sku": "SKU-ALPHA",
        "feed_sku_hash": "fsh_a1b2c3",
        "source": "source_system"
      },
      "price": 139.99,
      "reason": ["fit", "cushioning", "budget"]
    },
    {
      "rank": 2,
      "content_fingerprint": "cfp_7f9",
      "provenance": { "brand": "BrandB", "sku": "SKU-BETA" },
      "price": 129.00
    }
  ],
  "presentation": {
    "layout": "comparison_table",
    "summary_style": "regenerated",
    "image_policy": "regenerated"
  }
}

```

⸻

**8) Receipt webhook****Auth.** Merchant or agent signed JWT.

**Verb.** POST/v1/agent-checkouts

**Payload**

```json
{
  "order_id": "o_123",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T13:12:44Z",
  "agent_id": "agent.acme",
  "session_id": "s_7bk",
  "line_items": [
    { "content_fingerprint": "cfp_4a2", "sku": "SKU-ALPHA", "qty": 1, "price_paid": 129.99 }
  ],
  "merchant": "MerchantA",
  "currency": "USD"
}

```

Join onsession_idorcontent_fingerprint. That restores attribution without tags.
⸻

**9) Synthetic shopper panel****Goal.** Map what agents show for target queries.

**Runner.** Headless browser automation with scripted personas.
**Inputs.** Query suites, regions, budgets, intents.

**Capture.** Screens, DOM, ranked lists, prices, summaries.

**Store.** Object storage and a column store.

**KPIs.** Inclusion rate. Rank share. Price position. Copy drift.

**Query file**

```yaml
persona: value_seeker_us
region: US
queries:
  - "best air fryer under $150"
  - "quiet dishwasher stainless 24 inch"
schedule: daily 07:00
limits: { max_runs_per_agent: 200 }

```

Operate with restraint. Identify automation. Respect terms. No private surfaces.
⸻

**10) Consented human panel****Form.** Browser extension or mobile SDK.

**Scope.** Agent query, ranked results, prices, reasons.

**No PII.** Aggregate by session and region.

**Incentives.** Loyalty points. Price protection. Early access.

**Role.** Calibrate synthetic results. Correct sample bias.
⸻

**11) Owned agent and syndication****Owned agent.** Onsite experience with clear reasons and sources. Full logs by default.

**Syndication kit.**POST /v1/offerandGET /v1/facts/:sku. Third party agents can ground on these endpoints. Exposure pings become part of the contract.

**Offer response**

```json
{
  "session_id": "s_abc",
  "candidates": [
    { "rank": 1, "sku": "SKU-ALPHA", "score": 0.81, "reasons": ["fit","price"], "fingerprint": "cfp_x" },
    { "rank": 2, "sku": "SKU-BETA", "score": 0.78, "reasons": ["grip"], "fingerprint": "cfp_y" }
  ],
  "sources": ["catalog","reviews","specs"]
}

```

⸻

**12) Standards and a broker**Scope must be small and firm.

- One exposure schema and one receipt schema.
- Agent and merchant keys with rotation.
- Signature checks and policy checks at ingest.
- GS1 IDs for products. C2PA for media where possible.
- Clean room joins for lift studies when needed.

A neutral broker reduces friction. It also adds trust.
⸻

**13) KPIs and dashboards**- Inclusion rate by agent, query class, and region.
- Rank share with trend lines and step alerts.
- Share of selection and lift where receipts exist.
- Copy drift score versus canonical facts.
- Price position heatmaps.
- Agent bias drift by persona.
- Time to cart. Resolution rate inside owned agent.
⸻

**14) Security and trust**- Verify all signatures. Keep raw payloads.
- Collect the least data. No raw PII in agent logs.
- Consent flows for the human panel. Clear opt out.
- Red team prompts and rankings. Log policy hits.
⸻

**15) 90 day plan****Weeks 1 to 2.** Add feed IDs. Stand up exposure and receipt endpoints. Land data in a warehouse.

**Weeks 3 to 6.** Ship the synthetic runner. Run 100 queries on two agents. Daily cadence. Build a simple dashboard and alerts. Draft the extension spec.

**Weeks 7 to 10.** Pilot the human panel. Launch one merchant or agent receipt pilot. Publish a small syndication kit. Review results. Lock next steps.
⸻

**16) Risks and mitigation****Agent refusal.** Run panels. Publish benchmarks. Create pressure.

**ID loss.** Use several proofs. Hashes, facts, and media creds.

**Privacy risk.** Consent first. Aggregate by session.

**Legal friction.** Start with narrow scope partners.

**Ops drag.** Treat prompts and tools as code. Version and roll back.
⸻

**17) Proven analogs**- Broadcast and streaming: panels plus device logs.
- Programmatic ads: open schemas and third party checks.
- Mobile attribution: aggregated proofs without raw IDs.
- Music charts: content IDs plus point of sale logs.
⸻

**18) FAQ****Is AEO or GEO still worth it?** Yes. It helps rank. It does not restore truth.

**Can watermarked pixels work here?** No. Agents do not render them.

**Will agents share logs?** Some will. Panels cover gaps until deals exist.

**What about regenerated images?** Expect loss. Use several proofs.

**How large must the human panel be?** Start small. Use it to weight synthetic runs.

**What if receipts are blocked?** Start with one partner. Prove lift. Expand.
⸻

**Closing**Stop tuning carts. Build traffic control. Fund telemetry, evals, and policy that can be enforced. Price on actions, not seats. In twelve months, aim for rate limits, identity, and audit logs in place. That is how to scale without guessing.

**Appendix: They will say / You answer with**They will say: Shovels still matter.

You answer with: Keep them. They do not restore signal. Traces and receipts do.

They will say: We can track with pixels.

You answer with: Pixels need a renderer. Agents synthesize. No tag fire. Use server logs and signed receipts.

They will say: Agents will never share exposure logs.

You answer with: Some will for value. Start with receipts from a friendly merchant. Fill gaps with panels. Publish benchmarks.

They will say: Panels are fake traffic.

You answer with: They are audits. Calibrate with a small human panel. Use them to catch drift and rank loss.

They will say: This sounds heavy.

You answer with: Start tiny. Two endpoints. One query list. One dashboard. Ten weeks.

They will say: Legal will block consented panels.

You answer with: Scope the data. No PII. Session only. Clear opt in. Offer value back.

They will say: We already have AEO.

You answer with: Good. It improves rank. You still need truth on inclusion, rank share, and copy drift.

They will say: Pricing on activity hurts margin.

You answer with: It aligns cost with revenue. Seats do not. Set caps. Use rate limits.

They will say: Agents rewrite images and text. Watermarks fail.

You answer with: Expect loss. Use several proofs. Hashes, JSON-LD facts, and media credentials.

They will say: How big must the human panel be?

You answer with: Small is fine. Use it to weight synthetic runs.

They will say: Merchants will not send receipts.

You answer with: Start with one partner. Prove lift. Expand.
