I'm frequently asked how AI will change consulting.

My initial response is optimistic. We're seeing a massive resurgence of high-skill roles: the Forward Deployed Engineer, the Automation Engineer, the Agentic Architect. There is an tsunami of high-value work for people who can keep up.

But let's be blunt. The market—and especially our own organizations—is flooded with hype.

We are drowning in "slideware" and "marketecture" about "agentic this" and "conversational that." It's a charade. It's immediately apparent when you see these decks that the people presenting them are not speaking from experience.

They haven't *learned by doing*. They read something, and now they are parrots.

This hype is the sound of the old model dying. These "experts" are just "process-sellers" in a panic, trying to use the old tools (PowerPoint) to describe a new world that makes them obsolete.

AI is rapidly commoditizing "noise"—the low-judgment, high-process work that built entire consulting empires. The manual data gathering, the basic analysis, the "parroting" of frameworks... this is all being automated to zero.

This is the "Coder vs. Architect" split, in real-time.

- **The "Coder"** (the old model) executed a known process. They are the parrots. That job is evaporating.

- **The "Architect"** (the new model) provides human judgment. This is the FDE. This is the person who builds and *learns by doing*. They are the only ones providing "signal."

The optimism is for the architects and the builders. The new demand for "signal" is massive.

For everyone else—for the parrots and the marketitects—the reality is much simpler.

Adapt or die.
