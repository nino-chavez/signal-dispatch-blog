*Post 4 of 5 in Muscle Memory*

Everyone wants frictionless. Fast, fluent, done. But friction isn’t just a blocker—it’s where the work happens.

The struggle to name something, the messy draft, the rewrite that makes you squirm—*that’s* where you get sharper. That’s where your voice shows up. Not in the polish. In the fight.

AI skips the fog. Which is seductive. But sometimes the fog is where the good stuff hides.

If you remove every bump in the road, you lose the feel of the terrain. You stop noticing the turns. That’s not convenience. That’s numbness.
