In one month I burned through:

→ $400 of [Lovable.ai](http://Lovable.ai) credits → $400 of Kilo tokens → and an incredible amount of patience

All in the name of building a real, production-grade AI-coded app.

* * *

I started in *vibe coding mode* with Lovable — fluid, flexible, fast.

Then I shifted into *AI engineering mode* using Kilo and local VSCode workflows. Structure, constraints, type safety, linting, semantic tokens — the whole nine yards.

At first? Incredible. We took a prototype-grade codebase and hardened it with real engineering rigor.

But then... things started to break.

-   Docs drifted
    
-   Lint rules collided
    
-   Hotfixes created new bugs
    
-   Theme system collapsed
    
-   CSS went off the rails
    

I spent two days trying to rescue it. Eventually, I gave up. Nuked the local git. Kept the repo. Walked away.

* * *

Then I went back to Lovable. But this time, I came prepared.

✅ Bootstrap prompts with principles ✅ Set shared variables up front ✅ Define patterns, not just features ✅ If I pivot, I document ✅ If there's drift, I log it

Now every time I finish a feature, I ask:

> “If I needed to recreate this **exactly** — what would the prompt look like?”

Lovable answers. I save it.

🗂 feature-replay-xyz.txt 🗂 ai-drift-xyz.txt 🗂 ai-coding-convention-xyz.txt

This is how I'm building my AI Ops stack. One painful failure at a time. And no — I’m not done. But this time, I’m not starting from scratch either.
