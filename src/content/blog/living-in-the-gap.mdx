There‚Äôs a tension I carry in almost every interaction ‚Äî
between *being here*
and *already seeing what's next*.

Between presence
and projection.
Between waiting
and moving.

It‚Äôs the dissonance of living slightly ahead of the moment. Of scanning routes others haven‚Äôt seen yet ‚Äî not because I‚Äôm smarter, but because my mind moves that way by default. It pattern-matches, extrapolates, simulates. Not out of impatience ‚Äî but out of reflex.

The Frustration of DragWhen you‚Äôre built to scan ahead, everyday interactions start to feel like drag.
You‚Äôre holding a pace that isn‚Äôt yours.
You‚Äôre slowing your stride so others can keep up.
You‚Äôre answering questions you‚Äôve already resolved internally ‚Äî or worse, waiting for the question to be asked at all.

And over time, that waiting builds friction:

- A creeping restlessness.
- A quiet impatience.
- A sense that you're stuck on a loop you already transcended.

You don't want to be condescending.
You don‚Äôt want to be the person who‚Äôs "too far ahead to be helpful."
But you're also tired of pretending you just got there too.

The Cost of Being the Lead ScoutIf you‚Äôve ever led from the front ‚Äî in a project, a team, a vision ‚Äî you know this feeling intimately.

You‚Äôre the one charting the path.
Reading terrain.
Making adjustments on the fly.

But you‚Äôre also the one constantly looking back.

Did they make that turn?
Are they with me?
Do I need to slow down again?

And when the gap gets too wide, you face a painful choice:

- **Double back** and walk it slower ‚Äî again.
- **Pause** and risk losing your momentum.
- Or **keep going** and risk losing the pack entirely.

None of those feel good.

Especially when all you really want is a pack that can *run with you*.

The Dream of Pace MatchEvery high-functioning person I know longs for one thing:

**Pace match.**

Not just people who are ‚Äúsmart.‚Äù
People who can *move* ‚Äî who can process quickly, build quickly, adjust quickly.
People who don‚Äôt need the whole map explained because they‚Äôre already sketching it themselves.

Being around those people changes everything.
The friction drops.
The loop tightens.
The signal gets sharper.

You don‚Äôt have to slow down to be understood ‚Äî you move at speed *and* stay in sync.
No drag. No lag. No backtracking.

Just clean forward motion.

That‚Äôs rare. And precious. And, if I‚Äôm honest, **something I miss more often than I admit.**

But Here‚Äôs the PracticeUntil you find that perfect pace match ‚Äî
you have to lead with **empathy**, not urgency.

You have to practice **patience**, not superiority.

You have to remember:
The ability to scan ahead doesn‚Äôt make you better.
It just gives you a different vantage point.
And vantage points are only useful if they serve others ‚Äî not just yourself.

That‚Äôs the discipline:

- Not letting your forward velocity become dismissiveness.
- Not letting your frustration leak out as condescension.
- Not resenting the fact that leadership often *is* waiting. Again.

Holding the TensionSo I live in the gap.
Between where I *am* and where we *are*.
Between the pace I *could* go and the pace I *need* to hold.

Some days, I feel like a scout running loops.
Some days, I feel like a shepherd holding back a sprint.
Some days, I just feel tired of waiting.

But most days ‚Äî
I remind myself that this tension is part of the work.

That slowing down for others is not a burden,
if it means we arrive together.

üõë Reflection SignalIf you're someone who lives ahead of the moment ‚Äî
who scans, models, imagines, plans ‚Äî
ask yourself this:

Do you slow down with care?
Do you signal clearly?
Do you leave space for others to find the path *with* you?

Or have you quietly started walking alone?
