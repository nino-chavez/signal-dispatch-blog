I. Friday Night — FrictionI’d rather shoot volleyball games than untangle legacy HTML—but AES (the platform tournaments rely on) makes schedule-hunting a pain, and planning my courtside visits becomes cumbersome.

Two quick shots at automation went nowhere:

1. **“GPT, build me a parser.”** Generic prompt, brittle output.
2. **Classic HTML scraping.** Race-condition hell; one div shift killed the script.

By midnight I was back to swearing at the editor, convinced I hated coding again.

II. Saturday Morning — The BreakthroughDuring a frustration scroll through DevTools I hit the **Network** tab and finally asked the obvious question:

> “What else is flying over the wire?”

AES wasn’t serving HTML at all—it was calling a tidy JSON endpoint that already held **club names, matches, times, courts**. No scraping required.

**Pivot:** Pipe that JSON straight into Supabase, seed a quick schema, build UI on clean data.

Lesson tattooed on the forearm: *DevTools is still the best LLM.*

III. Saturday Afternoon — Flow StateWith data solved, I opened lovable.dev—AI pair partners that feel like senior devs who never tire of boilerplate. Fifteen minutes later I had:

- A React/Vite scaffold with dark-mode toggles baked in.
- Mobile friendly and responsive views.
- Supabase row-level security policies I wouldn’t have written on a weekend.

Coding felt playful again—less “hunt the semicolon,” more “compose features.”

IV. Sunday — *Epics as Prompts*Mid-flow a ridiculous thought landed: *Could I ship an MVP from a single Jira ticket?* The prompt was basically a beefed-up user story anyway.

Imagine a board where:

- **Gherkin** = executable instruction set.
- **Grooming** = prompt tuning.
- **Sprint Review** = demo of AI-generated build.

The BA who writes the story becomes a vibe-coder overnight, pressing **Run** on their own acceptance criteria. It’s half joke, half forecast—and closer than it sounds.

V. What Changed (and What Didn’t)1. **AI shrank the hate-zone.** The gap between *stuck* and *shipping* is now a weekend.
2. **Engineering intuition still matters.** The breakthrough was a human remembering to open DevTools.
3. **Prototype > speculate.** Two discarded attempts exposed the real path faster than architecture diagrams.
4. **The premium shifts upstream.** Clear, atomic stories out-value raw code hours.

VI. Closing SignalI started the weekend dreading another brittle scraper. I ended it joking that Jira tickets might compile. The joke lands because the compiler is already here—and it’s fluent in Epics.

Ship early, scrap fast, keep the Network tab open.

*(Feedback welcome—especially from any BAs ready to press the big green “Deploy Story” button.)*
