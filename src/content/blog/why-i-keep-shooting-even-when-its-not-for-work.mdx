*What photography gives me that nothing else does*

Most of what I do is strategic.
Tech leadership, content architecture, business transformation—it’s all high-context, high-pressure, high-stakes.

Photography is the opposite.

There’s no agenda.
No stakeholder.
No deliverable.

Just a moment I see, and the instinct to preserve it.

I still shoot Senior Nights, community matches, everyday scenes—not because I need the content, but because the act of shooting keeps me connected to something that matters more than strategy: presence.

Photography is where I don’t overthink.
It’s where I don’t need to justify anything.
It’s just **me, paying attention**—fully.

What the Camera Does That Strategy Can’t- It slows me down.
- It sharpens my instinct.
- It gets me out of my head and into the texture of the moment.

When I’m behind the lens, I’m not leading. I’m not fixing. I’m not thinking six moves ahead.

I’m noticing.

Why I Don’t “Just Shoot for Clients”If photography becomes a job, I lose the part of it that heals me.

This is the one space where I don’t need permission, polish, or performance.
It doesn’t matter if the light’s wrong.
It doesn’t matter if I’m the only one who sees the moment.
It just matters that I *showed up* for it—and kept something real from slipping away.

I’ll always build things.
I’ll always lead teams, launch strategies, press shirts, run drops.
But photography is the part that reminds me why I do any of that at all.

It’s the clearest signal I know.

That’s why I keep shooting.
Even when it’s not for work.
Especially then.
