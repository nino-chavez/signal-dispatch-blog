The Rules I Actually Follow*(Even if I Don’t Always Admit It)*

Everyone talks about having a “code.”
Most of it falls apart under pressure.

These are the rules I actually return to—the ones that survive bad weeks, high stakes, and broken plans. They’re not designed to impress. They’re designed to *hold*.

1. **Never let them see you sweat.**Not because I’m faking it. Because panic is contagious.
Calm isn’t for show—it’s a tool. I use it to keep the room steady while the signal clears. Pressure reveals most people. I’d rather it reveal my discipline.

2. **Get things done.**Talk is cheap. Decks are delay. If something matters, I move on it.
Ownership is my default setting—because waiting for perfect is just a prettier form of avoidance.

3. **Say “I don’t know” fast.**Pride slows teams down. I’d rather be honest and useful than clever and late.

4. **Write it down or it didn’t happen.**Meetings lie. Memory drifts. Writing makes the work real.
If I can’t explain it cleanly in writing, I don’t understand it clearly enough to build it.

5. **Handle the awkward.**Hard conversations are part of the job. Avoiding them isn’t kindness—it’s abdication.
I’d rather break the tension now than let it rot the team later.

6. **Speed doesn’t equal progress.**Busy isn’t the same as effective.
I’d rather move slow with purpose than fast in circles. Thrash wastes trust.

7. **Don’t complain if I’m not part of the solution.**If I’m not ready to help fix it, I stay quiet.
If I *am* ready, I roll up my sleeves before I open my mouth.

8. **Fatigue is signal, not weakness.**I’ve learned to read the wear and adjust—not shame it, not ignore it.
Burnout isn’t noble. It’s just expensive.

9. **Stay useful in the shadows.**I don’t need credit. I need outcomes.
If something gets better because I was in the room, that’s enough.

10. **No job is beneath me.**Execution matters. Sweating the details matters.
Titles don’t clean up the mess—people do. And I’ve never been above grabbing a broom.

This isn’t a pep talk. It’s just how I operate.
Not because it makes me look good—but because it keeps me good under pressure, in motion, and aligned with the kind of leader I respect.
