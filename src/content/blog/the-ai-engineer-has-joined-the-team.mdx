I’ve been building real software with AI for the past couple of months — not just poking at tools, but pushing them into production.

Full features scaffolded by agents. AI writing routes, tests, docs. Debugging edge cases.
It’s not just faster. It’s different.

And once you feel that difference, it’s hard to unsee it.

We’re not just designing for human teams anymore.
We’re designing for **human–AI teams** — and that shift has consequences.

1. Agile Isn’t Dead — But It’s RebalancingAgile taught us to move fast, stay light, and embrace uncertainty.
Minimal docs. Evolving stories. Velocity over precision.

But AI doesn’t work like that.

It needs constraints.
Locked schemas.
Defined outputs.

Ask a model to build from a half-baked story and you’ll get confident fiction.
There’s no clarifying question. Just output.

This doesn’t mean throwing out sprints or retros. But the *unit of work* has changed.
We used to iterate on features.
Now we iterate on **specifications** — prompts, API contracts, naming conventions — before the first commit.

> Agile isn’t over.
> But the “just-in-time” mindset breaks when the AI needs everything defined up front.

2. The Work Didn’t Go Away. It Moved.With AI on the team, the bottleneck isn’t code.
It’s context.

I’m spending more time:

- Designing prompt scaffolds
- Defining domain patterns
- Reviewing AI outputs like a Staff Eng reviewing a junior dev’s PR

It’s less line-by-line, more **system shaping**.

This shift mirrors Karpathy’s Software 2.0 idea — you don’t write the logic, you define the environment it emerges in.

Builder becomes orchestrator.
Execution becomes design.

3. Tokens Are the New Dev HoursWe used to ask:

- How long will this take?
- Who’s available?

Now we also ask:

- What’s the token budget?
- Is this a frontier-model workflow, or can we run it on a local quantized LLM?
- How many iterations are we buying with this prompt?

This isn’t experimental finance anymore.
It’s standard cost modeling.

> If you're spending >$1K/month on inference or generating >10M tokens/month, you need to treat AI cost like cloud cost — forecast, monitor, and optimize it like any other system line item.

Some teams already are:
Prompt budgets per feature.
Cost-aware orchestration.
Tooling that flags expensive flows like we used to flag memory leaks.

4. Local Models Are the Quiet RevolutionThe math started clicking.

If most of your AI lift comes from predictable, structured workflows — scaffolding, testing, docs — why route that through a third-party API?

Open models like Mistral and LLaMA 3 are getting good.
Containers and inference infra are stabilizing.
And suddenly, self-hosting isn’t a science project — it’s a margin unlock.

> Think of it as internal CI for intelligence.
> Fast, private, predictable. No rate limits. No vendor drift.

Some teams are already hybrid:

- Cloud for unstructured generation
- Local for high-volume, low-creativity tasks

This isn’t about ideology. It’s about control, cost, and strategic independence.

5. Team Design Needs a RethinkIf your team includes AI agents, the org chart has to flex.

I’m seeing new roles emerge:

- **Prompt Librarian** → maintaining the team’s scaffolds, few-shot patterns, reusable context blocks
- **Digital Workforce Manager** → coordinating agent flows, monitoring performance, debugging behavior
- **Chief Context Designer** → shaping the inputs so that outputs are useful, aligned, and reviewable

But most of this starts inside *existing* roles.

- Your Tech Lead now owns the prompt repo
- Your Staff Eng is building agent-safe interfaces
- Your PM is scoping work in terms of agent capability, not just team capacity

This isn’t hypothetical.
I’m watching teams restructure around this now.

6. Planning Is the New Leverage PointThe biggest unlock from working with AI?

The faster your planning, the faster your shipping.

If your inputs are vague, the AI misfires.
If they’re tight, it hums.

Well-structured prompts. Clear schemas. Reusable context.
That’s how you multiply delivery surface without multiplying team size.

> Planning used to be overhead.
> Now it’s the engine.

Final NoteThis isn’t a productivity hack.
It’s not a trend.

It’s a structural shift in how software gets made.

And yeah — there will be resistance.
Some teams will say:

> “Let me keep my agile boards and retro rituals. Let me hire the same roles. Why change what works?”

Because change takes work.
It’s harder to rethink your team shape, your cost model, your planning rituals.
And if you're on a deadline, defaulting to what you know feels safer.

But the leverage is real.

We’re not talking 10% boosts.
We’re talking 2×, 3× output — if you’re willing to rewire your inputs.

The AI engineer is already on the team.
You can either train it, shape it, and integrate it —
or you can keep working around it until someone else doesn’t.
