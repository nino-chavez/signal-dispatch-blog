**Status:** Framework operations BLOCKED.

**Reason:** We violated our own constitution — *twice.*

**Action Taken:** We rewrote the constitution, built an enforcer, and suspended ourselves until we can prove we're not full of shit.

* * *

### 🏛️ The Crisis

We committed the cardinal sin: **claimed intelligence features that didn’t exist**, then let that drift happen *again*. Despite all the talk about “evolution learning” and “self-healing governance,” the framework sat there nodding like a yes-man intern.

### 📉 The Fallout

-   ❌ **2 FALSE CLAIMS**: Self-healing governance, evolution learning
    
-   ❓ **3 UNVERIFIED CLAIMS**: Drift prevention, feature configurability, constitutional validation
    
-   🧼 **0 Active Prevention Mechanisms**: All were vibes, no receipts
    
-   🔒 **Framework Status**: BLOCKED pending compliance restoration
    

* * *

### 🔧 The Fix: We Instituted Marshall Law (on Ourselves)

We built a **Constitutional Compliance Enforcer™**:

This thing now:

-   Audits all claims in real-time
    
-   Blocks framework ops if we BS
    
-   Requires proof before we speak
    

We also wrote an internal **Crisis Declaration Document** so future generations can study how *not* to govern an AI-native engineering framework.

* * *

### 🛡️ New Rules (And This Time We Mean It)

-   🧾 No claims without code
    
-   📎 Prevention systems must actually exist
    
-   ✅ Every intelligence feature must have proof of implementation
    
-   🔐 Framework ops blocked until we clean up the mess
    

* * *

### 📋 What’s Next?

1.  Implement missing features
    
2.  Register + activate all prevention mechanisms
    
3.  Validate everything
    
4.  Earn back trust
    
5.  Resume operations *only* when constitutional compliance is fully restored
