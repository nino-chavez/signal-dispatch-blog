There’s this pattern I fall into.

I get frustrated—like *internally buzzing*—when it feels like I’m hearing something no one else notices. A shift in tone. A subtle rhythm. The faint feedback of a system about to break. And I’m not trying to be clever—it’s just how my brain works.

But when nobody else hears it… when people keep talking like everything’s fine… I start to spiral.

Am I just hearing things?
Am I inventing patterns to feel smart?
Do I have perfect pitch—or am I just humming to myself in a quiet room?

It’s hard to tell.

Because sometimes I do catch things early. I sense when the vibe is off. I hear what isn’t being said. I notice dissonance in a conversation or a plan—like a chord that doesn’t quite resolve.

It’s like I’ve developed this internal tuning fork, and it starts buzzing when something’s out of key.

But here’s the paradox:
The more I trust that instinct, the more I worry I’m just tone-policing noise.

Sometimes I’ll call something out that seems off, and no one else reacts. Or I’ll try to share an insight that sounds obvious *to me*—and it lands like static.

And then the doubt creeps in.
Am I genuinely hearing signal—or just *wanting* to be the one who hears it?

There’s a cost to being early.
You hear problems that aren’t “real” yet.
You try to harmonize with people who are still drumming a different beat.
You risk sounding performative instead of perceptive.

But there’s also a cost to ignoring that hum.

So I’m trying to sit in the static.
To trust the instinct, but question the performance.
To pause before I turn the volume up too loud.

No real resolution here. I’m still tuning my ear and working to figure out the line between observation and invention.
Between quiet confidence and quiet delusion.

Still wondering whether that thing I just heard was a real signal...or just the wind.
