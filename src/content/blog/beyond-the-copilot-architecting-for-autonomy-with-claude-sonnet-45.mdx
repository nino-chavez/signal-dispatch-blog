The age of the simple AI prompt is over. As models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 become more powerful, our role isn't just to ask questions—it's to architect a system for the AI to follow. Our prompts must become directives.

* * *

### The Old Approach: The Question

This is a good-faith prompt that asks the AI for an opinion. It's reactive, not proactive.

***Original Prompt:***

analyze the config, docs, and source code. also use our conversation history. given the new version of claude code we are now on, and the new sonnet4.5 model, do we need to revise any workflows in our development approach? do we need to update or improve upon the agent-os instructions? do we need to define additional or better subagents specific to our ways of working and/or our application? is there any thing else along these lines i'm not thinking of to improve the clarity and efficiency of our development experience?

### The New Approach: The Directive

This prompt doesn't ask for an opinion; it commands a comprehensive, multi-phase project. It leverages the new model's ability to handle long, autonomous sessions and manage complex tasks by giving it a clear mission and guardrails. It's a blueprint for action.

***Enhanced Prompt:***

You are the lead architect for an autonomous development agent. Your primary objective is to redesign our workflow to leverage the new capabilities of Claude Code, specifically the Sonnet 4.5 model and its long-context, agentic features. Your mission is to perform a comprehensive systems analysis and provide a strategic plan.

Phase 1: Foundational Analysis & System Design

1\. **Analyze System:** Read our entire codebase, configuration, and Agent-OS instructions. 2. **Revise Workflow:** Propose a new, high-level workflow that shifts our focus from line-by-line coding to high-level intent engineering and system orchestration. 3. **Update Instructions:** Enhance our Agent-OS instructions to utilize Sonnet 4.5's new features, including rules for memory and context management. 4. **Architect Subagents:** Propose a new architecture for specialized subagents to handle specific tasks within our application's domain.

Phase 2: Evaluation & Refinement

1\. **Evaluate Risks:** Define how we will ensure increased AI velocity doesn't create new integration or testing bottlenecks. 2. **Define Oversight:** Articulate the key risks of this new approach and the process for human review of autonomous sessions.
