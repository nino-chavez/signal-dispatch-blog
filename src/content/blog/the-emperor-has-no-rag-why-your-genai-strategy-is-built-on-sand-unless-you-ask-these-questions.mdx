Let's be brutally honest. The GenAI world is awash with "experts." You see them everywhere: shouting about "paradigm shifts," "synergistic AI transformations," and the inevitable disruption of... well, everything.

But for every enthusiastic pronouncement, I see a fundamental gap. A chasm between the slick slide decks and the messy reality of building something that actually *works*, provides measurable value, and doesn't secretly hemorrhage cash.

It’s time to call out the "Markitechts" – those who expertly weave narratives but can't draw an architecture diagram that holds water, or explain a true operational cost. They're selling you a magic show, not an engineering solution. And frankly, it’s actively *harming* our ability to leverage this incredible technology responsibly.

### My Manifesto: It's Time to Raise the Floor

This isn't about me. Those who know me understand I don't chase the spotlight. This is about **raising the floor** for everyone. It's about moving past the superficial "tell" and demanding the gritty "show." Because a high floor—a universally understood foundation of practical, operational knowledge—is far more resilient than a few isolated high-flyers.

If you're truly building with GenAI, if you're truly leading a team or investing in this space, stop asking *what* GenAI can do. Start asking *how*.

Here's my simple litmus test. Ask your GenAI "expert" these questions. If they flounder, if they pivot to buzzwords, or if they can't provide specifics, you've found your Markitecht.

1.  **The Pipeline & Trade-offs:** "Walk me through the data pipeline for your RAG implementation. Specifically, what were the non-obvious trade-offs you made in your chunking strategy, and *why* did you make them that way?"
    
2.  **The True Cost:** "Beyond initial training/inference, what's your granular formula for estimating the *total operational cost* of this agentic system over a year, including re-training, human-in-the-loop, and obscure cloud egress fees? How do you account for 'Tokens Are Dev Hours'?"
    
3.  **The Proof of Value:** "How are you measuring model performance *quantitatively* against a specific business objective, beyond a generic benchmark? Show me your framework for qualitative evaluation, too. How do you know it's not just hallucinating elegantly?"
    
4.  **The Inevitable Failure:** "Describe a significant time this specific GenAI approach failed in production. What was the root cause, and how did you architect the system differently to account for that failure mode *today*?"
    

If they can answer these with precision, with details on real-world constraints, compromises, and lessons learned, then you've found someone genuinely building. If not, you're likely listening to the digital equivalent of a snake-oil salesman.

### Enough Talk. Show Me the Code (and the Architecture, and the P&L).

The future of AI in the enterprise depends not on magical thinking, but on rigorous engineering, thoughtful architecture, and a deep understanding of operational realities.

Let's stop applauding the showmen. Let's start demanding the engineers. Let's raise the floor.

What do *you* think? What's your litmus test for a true GenAI builder?
