*Less friction, more clarity*

I didn’t start using AI to save time.
I started because the blank page was beating me.

I had thoughts worth writing down, but no momentum.
AI gave me just enough structure to move.
Now, it’s part of how I think.

But here’s the important part:
I don’t use AI to replace thinking.
I use it to reduce drag.

What I Use AI For (And What I Don’t)✅ I use it to:

- Structure rough ideas so I don’t stall
- Challenge my assumptions in early drafts
- Turn fragments into formats
- Help me notice patterns I might be too close to see
- Get out of my own voice when I need perspective

❌ I don’t use it to:

- Write final copy for me
- Speak in a tone that isn’t mine
- Do the work I haven’t already wrestled with
- Pretend I know more than I do

If I haven’t lived it, tested it, or seen it in the field—I don’t publish it.
The AI might help me write it. But the experience is mine.

My Basic Workflow1. **I start messy**I dump voice notes, bullet points, or loose thoughts into ChatGPT.
This is the “get it out of my head” phase.

2. **I ask for structure**I prompt it to shape that mess into something usable:

> “Group these into themes.”
> “Turn this into a post outline.”
> “Give me a first draft without losing the tone.”

3. **I refine by talking to it**The draft becomes a conversation. I don’t treat it as finished—I challenge it, reshape it, rewrite with it.

It’s more like pair-writing with a hyper-fast collaborator who’s always on and never offended.

4. **I bring it back to human**Final edits happen offline or in a markdown editor. This is where I make sure it sounds like me—not like a tool.

Why This Works for MeI lead. I build. I create. I mentor. I write.

I don’t always have time to switch modes cleanly.
AI helps me reduce context-switching cost.
It lets me capture thoughts while they’re hot.
And it lets me re-enter the work quickly, even after a chaotic day.

It’s not about speed. It’s about access.
Access to clarity when my bandwidth is low but my mind is still going.

If You Want to Use AI This WayHere’s what I’d tell you:

- Don’t try to automate. Try to accelerate.
- Don’t wait for the perfect use case. Start with something that feels stuck.
- Don’t expect it to do the work for you. Expect it to help you *do your own work better.*

Start where the friction is.
Build from there.

AI isn’t my shortcut.
It’s my clarity tool.
And used right—it makes me more present, not less.
