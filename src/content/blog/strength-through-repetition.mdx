I used to stall at the blank page.
Not for lack of ideas — but because of the *gap*.

The gap between what I felt and what I could articulate.
Between how I think and how I thought I was supposed to sound.
Between the mess in my head and the polished bullet points I thought people expected.

But the thing about the blank page is: it doesn’t care.
It won’t judge you. It won’t edit you.
It just waits.

So I started showing up.

Bad outlines. Messy metaphors.
False starts. Fragmented voice.
Again. And again. And again.

And somewhere in the repetition, something changed.

**Practice builds callouses.**
Not the kind that make you numb —
the kind that let you *grip*.

Now, the blank page isn’t a threat.
It’s a surface.
A sparring partner. A gym.

I don’t need to know exactly where I’m going.
I just need to move.
Write into the signal.
Sort by feel. Shape by friction.

I don’t write because I have the answer.
I write because it’s how I tune my thinking.
It’s how I learn the edges of my voice.
It’s how I remember that clarity lives on the other side of articulation.

The page is still blank.
But I’m not scared of it anymore.
