Last week I built a production-ready app from scratch using AI.
One week. One developer. Real users. Real infrastructure.

The catch? I didn’t do it alone — I had AI teammates.

And they weren’t free.

Not just in credits.
In attention. In retries. In debugging mistakes *they* made.

I’ve been thinking a lot about what that cost actually is. Here’s the pattern I’m seeing:

> Tokens are dev hours.
> Prompt tax is real.
> And waste is no longer invisible.

The Traditional Model: Burn Time, Not TokensIn a normal dev cycle, bad code and bad assumptions still cost time — but that time is baked into salaries. Hidden in Jira boards. Spread across "velocity." You don’t get a line-item receipt for every wrong guess.

If your senior dev spends 4 hours debugging an integration that was supposed to take one, you probably won't even know. At best, it shows up in a retro.

With humans, *waste is absorbed.*
With AI, *waste is metered.*

And once you see it — you can’t unsee it.

The AI Engineer Has a Price TagEvery prompt has a cost. Every mistake has a token count. Every time the model forgets what you said three minutes ago, it burns another 1,200 tokens — and your patience.

Here’s what I noticed while building the LPO Bracket Manager:

- **Initial schema prompt →** ✅ Valid result (~$0.14)
- **Rewrite with fix →** ✅ Clean tweak (~$0.11)
- **Regeneration attempt →** ❌ Wrong syntax (~$0.21)
- **Re-prompt with extra context →** ✅ Good output (~$0.13)

That’s **$0.59 just to get one chunk of usable SQL.**
Now multiply that by 500 interactions a week.

Prompt Tax: The Cost of "Almost There"I call this the **prompt tax** — the cost of getting the AI to do something you thought it already knew how to do.

You pay this tax when:

- The AI hallucinates an import path
- It forgets the file structure you just gave it
- It reverts a function to a prior, incorrect state
- You burn tokens teaching it *not* to repeat a bad pattern

A strong junior dev might take 3 hours.
AI might take 4 minutes — *but with 5 retries and $1.12 of token waste.*

Speed and cost are now uncoupled.
Attention is quantized.
And you’re the one footing the bill.

Waste Is Now Visible — and That’s GoodFor years, engineering waste has been invisible:

- Slack threads re-explaining things
- Code reviews correcting basic logic
- Duplicate work across sprints
- Context resets after PTO

We never really *tracked* that waste — we just accepted it.

But with AI, every retry is measurable.
Every hallucination has a price.
And every bad output forces you to ask:
*Why did this happen? How do I prevent it next time?*

That’s not frustrating — that’s an opportunity.

Designing for AI WasteOver the last few weeks, I’ve shifted how I build systems for AI teammates:

- I create **prompt scaffolds** with tone, formatting, and constraints
- I write **coding guidelines** specifically for the model
- I use **Kilo AI** to format prompts like tasks in VSCode
- I maintain **Docusaurus** docs-as-code to reduce re-explaining logic
- I added a **theme management layer** to isolate design tokens — normally a full-team feature, done in two rounds with AI

This isn’t just development.
It’s *training the system not to waste my time.*

> You don’t just ship code anymore.
> You shape the environment that makes code shippable.

From Token Burn to Team DisciplineIf you’re leading a team, here’s the shift:

- Stop measuring just output — **start measuring retries**
- Budget for **prompt tax** — literally and emotionally
- Create **AI-ready docs**, not just human-facing ones
- Recognize that **context shaping** is now a team skill

The dev team of the future won’t just be fast — it’ll be *self-healing*.
Because it will treat AI not as magic, but as a junior teammate who can learn — if you build the systems for it to remember.

Closing Thought> AI doesn’t eliminate waste.
> It exposes it.
> In tokens. In retries. In your Stripe receipt.

That’s a feature, not a bug.

It means we can finally see where our attention *actually* goes —
and we can design systems to reduce waste at the source.
Not just by writing better prompts…

…but by teaching the system to forget less.

I’m building real-time prompt analytics tools, documenting waste patterns, and architecting AI-led apps in the open.

Let’s build like waste matters.
