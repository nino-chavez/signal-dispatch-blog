> "Give me your cell phone right now. Then try to move from Dallas to Denver without it." – me, in a Teams rant that kicked this whole thing off

1. Splash‑downLast summer a buddy dropped his phone in the Arkansas River while fly‑fishing. One *plunk* and his life went offline:

- boarding pass
- two‑factor codes
- maps, money, mom’s birthday reminder

He spent the next two days sprinting between print stations like it was 2003. He survived—but every cracked‑screen minute screamed the same truth: once a tool is **fully woven** into the way we live, its sudden absence is a Category 5 pain point.

2. Run the clock back to 2000Pretend you’ve time‑traveled to the year 2000. No smartphone. No cloud. You can *technically* ship a package or book a flight, but the friction feels medieval. Now flip it—parachute a 2000‑era project manager into 2025 corporate life with no app literacy. Chaos. That gap between *possible* and *practical* is what real integration looks like.

3. Now look at AI inside your orgRight now AI is the awkward plus‑one at every corporate party—invited, hyped, but never given a seat that actually matters. We’re rolling out copilots, vector DBs, slide gen toys. But:

- Workflows don’t change.
- Insights die in slideware.
- Governance is an afterthought.

If all those AI toys vanished tomorrow, would anyone lose sleep? If the answer is “eh, not really,” you don’t have AI—you have **optional accessories.**

4. The Lost‑Phone Test for AIAsk five blunt questions:

1. **Mission‑critical?** Which decisions *stop* if the model is offline?
2. **Muscle memory?** Do teams instinctively reach for AI the way they reach for Outlook or Slack?
3. **Fallback rituals?** If the bot dies at 4 p.m., is there a paper map equivalent?
4. **Learning loop?** Does every interaction make the org smarter, or is it a one‑off “lol cool demo”?
5. **Owner?** Who wakes up at 3 a.m. when the LLM mislabels customer tiers?

Score yourself. If you’re batting under .300, you’re still in the “phone in the river” phase—tools present, dependency absent.

5. Enter the CIO 2.0 (Chief **Intelligence** Officer)Most orgs treat **intelligence** like plumbing: install a shiny model, hope it flows. What’s missing is a role (or function) that owns the **integration fabric**—strategy ↔ product ↔ ops ↔ human workflow. Call it CIO 2.0. Responsibilities, draft version:

- Map where AI should *change how work gets done*, not just sprinkle auto‑complete.
- Track whether the org is getting **smarter, not just faster.**
- Build lightweight governance that doesn’t smother creativity.
- Keep strategy, tech, and change management in one conversation.

6. Consulting smell testIn the chat, my crew immediately asked: “Could we benchmark this? Six‑week assessment?” That’s consultant‑speak for **market signal.** Leaders are hungry for a simple litmus test that cuts through AI FOMO.

7. Your moveTry the Lost‑Phone Test this week:

1. Pick one AI tool that’s supposedly game‑changing.
2. Turn it off for 48 hours.
3. Watch the chaos (or lack thereof).

If nothing breaks, integration is still a PowerPoint fantasy. Reach out—I’m piloting a lightweight *Intelligence Integration* workshop that turns this diagnostic into an action plan.

Because the phone is already in the river. What matters is whether you learned to swim—or just bought another fragile shiny thing.
