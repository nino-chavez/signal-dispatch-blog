This blog has a new name.

What started as **Signal Reflex** is now called **Signal Dispatch**.

The change isn’t cosmetic — it reflects a shift in how I use this space.

**Signal Reflex** was built on observation. A place to notice, log, and work through ideas before they were ready. It was about sensing patterns, naming dynamics, and holding a mirror to what was happening in my work, leadership, and thinking.

But with the speed of iteration, the posture changed.

I’m not just noticing anymore — I’m transmitting.
And more than that: I’m choosing what’s worth sending.

That’s why I don’t just **transmit**, but **dispatch**.

**Transmission** can be ambient, automatic. It flows.
But **dispatch** implies intent. Curation. A decision to release.
Each post here now carries that energy — not just a reflection, but a delivery.

I’m using AI tools to tighten the loop between idea and articulation.
I’m writing in arcs, not just fragments.
I’m not just testing language — I’m choosing it.

**Signal Dispatch** reflects that shift.
Still human. Still iterative. But released with intent.

—

Same voice. Sharper purpose.
Thanks for reading.
More arcs soon.
