Most of my day is spent navigating complex systems—aligning business strategy with tech execution, solving problems when the blueprint doesn’t fit. After hours, I switch to capturing emotion through a lens. Two different modes. Same instinct: find the signal, act with purpose.

**Signal Reflex** is where I write those moments down before they fade.

This isn’t a play to go viral. I’m not here to build an audience or launch a personal brand. I just needed a spot to think out loud without all the fluff.
These posts are where I work through patterns I’m seeing, frameworks I’ve pressure-tested, and moments—on the court or in the boardroom—that leave a mark. Some of it’s strategic. Some of it’s personal. All of it’s real.

Sometimes you’ll find posts about how I use AI in consulting—outside the marketing slides. Other times it’s reflections from the media side—like why I shoot senior nights with the same focus I’d give a championship match. And now and then, it’ll just be stuff I’m still figuring out.

If you know me, this’ll probably make sense. If you don’t, no worries—I’m not writing to convince anyone.

This is just my way of staying sharp and staying honest.

**Welcome to Signal Reflex.**
