Most apps toggle between "light" and "dark." Ours needed more.

When you're building tools for real-world events — like managing volleyball tournaments across gyms, beaches, and low-lit evening leagues — your UI has to flex with the physical environment. Our theme system couldn’t just be aesthetic. It had to *perform* under sun glare, gym lights, and accessible tech setups.

So we ran a full audit of our theme system.

Here’s what we found (and fixed).

* * *

### 🎨 THEME STRATEGY

We support four environment-based themes:

1.  **Indoor Mode** – default light theme for gym lighting
    
2.  **Evening Mode** – dark mode for low-light venues
    
3.  **Outdoor Mode** – max-contrast theme for sunlight and glare
    
4.  **Accessible Mode** – high-contrast option for visual impairments
    

Each theme is implemented via CSS custom properties (src/styles/colors.css), with semantic naming (--foreground, --muted, --accent, etc.) to support clarity and override consistency.

* * *

### ✅ WHAT’S WORKING

-   Strong contrast ratios (13:1–21:1) across all environments
    
-   Brand colors hold up across light/dark variants
    
-   Semantic token structure makes overrides clean and maintainable
    

* * *

### 🚨 WHAT NEEDED FIXING

### 🔧 HIGH-CONTRAST MODE (P0)

-   **Incomplete**: 8+ CSS variables were missing
    
-   **Fallback chaos**: Inherited colors broke expected contrast
    
-   **Fix**: Defined a complete high-contrast palette with max visibility:
    

### 🌞 OUTDOOR MODE (P0)

-   **Too bright**: Dark teal and gold weren’t visible in real sunlight
    
-   **No anti-glare tweaks**: Pure white backgrounds created reflection
    
-   **Fix**: Darkened all key colors and replaced shadow reliance with bold borders:
    

### 🏐 INDOOR & EVENING (P1/P2)

-   Muted text was too light in indoor mode (--muted-foreground: 215 16% 47%)
    
-   Evening mode slightly overshot brightness on secondary elements
    
-   Fixed with subtle tweaks to tone down and improve legibility

### 🧪 WCAG COMPLIANCE SNAPSHOT

Theme Ratio WCAG AAA Pass? Indoor 13.9:1 ✅ ✅ Evening 10.6:1 ✅ ✅ Outdoor 21:1 ✅ ✅ High Contrast 21:1 ✅\* ✅\*

\*Basic text only — needed full variable coverage

* * *

### 🧰 TESTING PLAN

**Automated**

-   Contrast ratio validation
    
-   CSS variable completeness check
    
-   WCAG linting pass
    

**Manual**

-   Sunlight test (real devices)
    
-   Evening test (low-light)
    
-   Screen reader + high zoom
    
-   Color-blind simulation
    

* * *

### 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

-   All themes hit 4.5:1 or better for normal text
    
-   100% of required CSS tokens defined across themes
    
-   Positive field testing from tournament organizers
    
-   No regressions in focus state, accessibility, or readability
    

* * *

### 💡 TAKEAWAY

Don't design themes. Design for *environments*.

Real users don’t care if your dark mode looks cool — they care if they can read pool assignments on a sun-drenched iPad at 10AM on a beach court. Our design system now reflects that.

If you’re building real-world apps, ask yourself:

**How does your UI perform in the environments your users live in?**
