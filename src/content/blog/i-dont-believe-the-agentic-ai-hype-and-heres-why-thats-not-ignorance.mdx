Catching up with a peer recently and part of the conversation landed on — half-joking, half-incredulous — how *I* of all people, someone building software and systems with AI every day, **don’t believe in agentic AI**.

“You seriously aren’t using agents yet?”

I get the surprise. I’ve built real production workflows using structured prompts, modular AI tools (like Kilo, Lovable), and memory scaffolds. I use AI to code, test, document, enforce rules, manage themes, even generate PRDs. I’m not an AI skeptic.

But I am skeptical of the **agentic abstraction layer** — the idea that we can just hand off a goal to an autonomous AI agent and let it plan, reason, execute, and adapt on its own.

Not because I don’t understand it. But because I’ve **lived through the limits** of every piece that goes into it.

* * *

### The Core Problem: Drift Multiplies, Not Disappears

Even with **my own prompting**, strict memory systems, and tight schema enforcement — there is **still drift**.

Now layer in:

-   A second LLM trying to prompt *another* LLM
    
-   Tool calls that may silently fail or hallucinate outputs
    
-   Plans with no execution safeguards
    
-   Scratchpad memory that rewrites itself mid-run
    

You don’t reduce fragility. You multiply it.

You’re now trusting an LLM to:

-   Prompt better than you
    
-   Plan more reliably than you
    
-   Debug and self-correct faster than you
    

…even though **you already know how fragile and hallucination-prone** the underlying models are.

> 🧯 **Let’s be honest: the emperor has no guardrails.** If you’ve ever tried to build something real with these systems, you already know — most agentic demos are just Rube Goldberg machines for calling GPT-4 in a loop with fancier error messages.

### When Is Agency Real?

I’m not anti-agent. I’m anti-fantasy.

Real agent-like behavior shows up when:

-   The task is low-risk and high-volume
    
-   The workflows are observable, recoverable, and testable
    
-   The agent isn’t the planner — *I am*
    

In other words:

> Don’t outsource intelligence. Outsource tedium.

Build a sync monitor that watches match logs and retries failed requests. Build a test runner that confirms UI flows against Kilo specs. Build a memory coach that asks, “Want me to store this pattern?”

That’s agency with constraint. Useful. Measurable. Bounded.

### What I Do Believe In

I believe in:

-   Declarative prompt stacks
    
-   Type-safe, memory-aware scaffolds
    
-   Modular AI toolchains with clearly defined roles
    
-   Human-in-the-loop plans with CI-level enforcement
    
-   Schema-first design with rollback paths
    

In other words: **AI systems with accountability**.

So when I say I don’t believe the hype around agentic AI, I’m not being a hater. I’m just someone who’s actually been burned by AI drift — and decided not to add *another* drift-prone actor into the system.

* * *

If you’ve built something *real* with agentic AI that holds up under real-world complexity, I’d genuinely love to see it.

But until then, I’ll keep building AI systems with grip, not glitter.
