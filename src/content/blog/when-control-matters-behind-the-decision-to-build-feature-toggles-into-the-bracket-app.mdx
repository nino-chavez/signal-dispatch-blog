Sometimes the feature isnâ€™t for the user.

Itâ€™s for us â€” the **system operators**, the maintainers, the ones who have to keep the app online when the fire starts. Or steer quietly into a beta when the paintâ€™s not dry yet.

This is one of those features.

### ðŸ’¡ The Instinct

Weâ€™ve been moving fast with the bracket app â€” too fast, maybe. New features like theme management, demo mode, admin controls â€” they all assume the world is working exactly as planned.

But what happens when something breaks? Or when we want to test a feature in production, but only for a few users?

Thatâ€™s where **feature toggles** come in.

Not just a kill switch. A **framework for conditional execution**, built into the bones of the system.

I jotted down the first five immediately:

-   Disable new registrations
    
-   Disable admin site access
    
-   Disable tournament creation
    
-   Disable demo mode
    
-   Disable custom theme creation
    

No whiteboard. No backlog grooming. The need was obvious.

### ðŸ§  Design Goals

This wasnâ€™t going to be a messy if (isProd) hack job. We needed:

-   A **Supabase-backed toggle system** with environment and role filtering
    
-   A way to **cache and evaluate toggles** client-side
    
-   A hook like useFeatureToggle() to keep React declarative
    
-   No UI yet â€” CLI or Supabase-first is fine
    
-   RLS enforcement so only super\_admin can flip switches
    

With that, I dropped the prompt to Kilo.

### ðŸ¤– The Prompt to Kilo

Hereâ€™s what I gave our AI teammate:

### ðŸ§± Laying the Foundation

This feature isnâ€™t just about control. Itâ€™s about **agency** â€” for the system itself and for the operators behind it.

To test safely. To react fast. To gatekeep with intention.

Weâ€™re not just building apps. Weâ€™re building the **switches** that run them.

* * *

### ðŸ›  Whatâ€™s Next

Kiloâ€™s plan is landing next. Once itâ€™s in, weâ€™ll:

-   Review for alignment
    
-   Add toggle enforcement + caching
    
-   Wire them into routes, actions, and guards
    
-   Ship them quietly â€” off by default
    

And from there? We scale it. Maybe per-tournament experiments. Maybe staged rollouts by role. If the bracket app is turning into **infra**, this is our **control panel**.
