excerpt: "The story that you’re too damaged to change is just another form of avoidance. False exemption doesn’t always sound like pride—it often sounds like hopelessness. But even if you’re not to blame for how the storm started, you’re still responsible for how you move through it."

*Post 4 of 4 in* **False Exemption: Why We Reject the Tools That Could Free Us**

**Go to the first post in the series: **[**Standing in the Rain**](/standing-in-the-rain/)

False exemption doesn’t always show up as arrogance.

It’s not always, *“That advice doesn’t apply to me.”*
Sometimes it’s quieter.
Sometimes it sounds like “I’m too far gone.”
“I’ve tried and failed too many times.”
“Other people have more to work with than I do.”

This form of resistance wears the mask of defeat.
But underneath, it’s still about **opting out of responsibility**.

Let me be clear:
You are not broken.
But you are not off the hook.

You’re not exempt from the hard work just because you’ve been through more than others.
You’re not disqualified from progress just because it hasn’t worked before.
You’re not doomed to the storm just because you’ve spent years soaking in it.

You are still accountable—for your next step, your next thought, your next effort.

I say this with compassion, not judgment.
Because I’ve stood at the edge of that story too.

I’ve felt like the damage was permanent.
Like my patterns were just who I am.
Like change was something other people got to do.

And the truth is… those thoughts are seductive.
They feel like realism.
They feel like surrender.
But they are still a choice.

> **Hopelessness can be a shield.**
> A way to avoid risking disappointment.
> A way to stay safe in the identity you already know.

But safety isn’t the same as peace.
And surrender isn’t always healing.
Sometimes, it’s just another version of hiding.

So if this series has stirred something uncomfortable in you—good.

That’s what it’s supposed to do.

I’m not here to hand you a plan or preach a fix.
I’m here to say:

> You might not be to blame for the storm.
> But you’re still the one holding the umbrella.

And at some point, you have to decide if you’re willing to stay soaked…
…or finally, finally, try staying dry.
