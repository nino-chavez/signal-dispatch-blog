Been deep in the zone building with AI tools like GPT, Kilo, and Lovable. Pairing them with Vite + Supabase to generate real production software. I’ve got a solid workflow. Clear prompt stacks. Good results. But something’s been bugging me — and it just clicked.

**Here’s the realization:**

> Every AI coding task should be treated like a Jira story.

Because that’s what humans need to start work safely. And AI is no different.

* * *

**🧠 What I mean by this:**

Imagine every prompt stack **starts** with a predefined issue template like:

-   **Bug** → Injects: file path, error message, logs, expected behavior
    
-   **Feature** → Injects: schema refs, RLS, UI interactions, validation rules
    
-   **Refactor** → Injects: architectural goals, existing drift, test coverage
    
-   **Spike** → Injects: known unknowns, edge cases, current constraints
    

Each one kicks off a prompt that **already knows** the shape of the work. No wasted tokens. No ambiguous context. Just direct instructions, like a safe handoff between teammates.

* * *

**🛠️ Why this matters:**

-   It **prevents architectural drift**
    
-   It **reduces hallucinations and fragility**
    
-   It makes AI output **safe to commit, review, and ship**
    
-   It lets us **automate pretext** and build **prompt scaffolds** like infra
    
-   It gets us closer to a world where **AI agents** can pick up real tasks without babysitting
    

This isn’t just about better prompts.

This is **AI-native software engineering.**

* * *

**And here’s the wild part:**

Almost no one is doing this yet. Not in a structured, repeatable way. But the pattern is emerging — and it’s time to build it.

* * *

**⚙️ Next move:**

I’m working on a registry of **AI Story Types** tied to development categories, schema-aware injection, and safe prompt chunking. Treating prompt stacks like reusable, versioned infrastructure. If you’re building in this direction — or want to — let’s connect.

* * *

Light bulb’s on. Let’s ship the system.
