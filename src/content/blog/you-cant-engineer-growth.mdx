*This started as a rant while driving.*

One of those moments where you say something out loud and realize—wait, that’s the whole point.

Someone brought up a player transferring clubs, and it spiraled into the usual talk: exposure, opportunity, better coaching.

And I get it.

But here’s what I couldn’t stop thinking:

**You can’t engineer growth.**
Not in volleyball. Not in life. No matter how much structure or strategy you throw at it.

What We’re Really DoingAt our club, we don’t build athletes on an assembly line.
We build the conditions for growth: structure, repetition, challenge, support.

But whether or not a player *grows* into their leadership potential—that’s not something we can script.

We can’t force it. We can’t promise it.
And we definitely can’t package it up like a product.

What we can do is show up, coach with care, and build a culture that holds players accountable to more than just stats.

This Isn’t a FactoryWhen a player transfers to another club, people often act like it’s a business move.

Better exposure. More wins. Bigger promises.

But volleyball isn’t Wall Street. And club sports aren’t factories.

We don’t work with standardized parts.
We don’t build to spec.
Every group of boys is different. Every season is a new story.

You can’t engineer trust.
You can’t fast-forward chemistry.
And you definitely can’t shortcut self-awareness.

High-Performance Is Real—But It’s Not GuaranteedYes, high-performance programs matter.
Yes, structured environments and rigorous reps can unlock potential.
But even then—growth only sticks when the player is *ready* for it.

And readiness isn’t a feature. It’s earned.
Through failure. Through repetition. Through showing up even when it’s hard.

We Play the Long GameWe don’t panic when players leave.
We don’t promise transformation in a season.
We don’t chase highlight reels.

Because we’re not in this to create the *most polished team photo*.
We’re in it to send better young men into the world than we received.

Sometimes that means losing early and learning hard.
Sometimes that means a player doesn’t peak until after their club career is over.

We’re good with that.

Because the wins that matter most?
They don’t hang in a gym.
