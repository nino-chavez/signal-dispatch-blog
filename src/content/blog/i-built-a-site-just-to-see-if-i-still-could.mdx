I built a website just to see if I still could.

Thatâ€™s not a flex. I didnâ€™t spin up a full-stack app or architect a multi-region backend. I didnâ€™t even need a site, really. I just needed a real-enough problem to remind myself what it feels like to build from scratch.

It started as an experiment: Could I get ChatGPT to generate a decent single-page site for a grassroots volleyball event series Iâ€™ve been planning? Something clean, modern, and functional. Not flashyâ€”just good enough to ship.

Because to do something is to learn something. And for me, it sticks better when thereâ€™s a personal reason behind it.

Prompting Isnâ€™t BuildingAt first, I treated it like a prompt challenge. Could I guide the LLM to give me the layout, content, and aesthetic I had in my head?

The answer: kinda.

I got close enough to see the shape of it. But not close enough to publish. And each round of copy-paste felt like waiting for a local dev server to restartâ€”slow and clumsy.

Thatâ€™s when I stopped fighting the tools and started setting up the system.

Muscle Memory in the TerminalFirst came GitHub and a shell repo. Then SSH key setup. Then remembering how to clone, push, and actually work in a local repo. That led me to Netlify for deployment, which introduced its own (welcome) constraints. I hadnâ€™t touched a CI/CD pipeline in years.

Next came VS Code. Plugins. Live server preview. Auto-formatting. It felt like shaking off rustâ€”annoying at first, then oddly satisfying.

Once things were wired up, I started using ChatGPT less like a code generator and more like a junior developer. Fast at boilerplate. Fine at refactors. Bad at decisions. It workedâ€”if I stayed in the lead.

Choosing Control (Then Letting It Go)Eventually I realized I was jumping through hoops to avoid using a template engine like Squarespace. I wanted full control of the code. But I also wanted polish and speed.

I tried Webflow, Wix, and even flirted with WordPress. But they all came with the same friction: abstraction wrapped in visual clutter. Tools built for a different kind of builder.

I went back to Squarespace. It was already where I registered my domains. I picked a clean theme and started customizing. I still used some command line tools. I still explored SVG generators. I still embedded filtered Instagram feeds tailored by hashtag.

The point was never to avoid tools. The point was to re-engage with the process. To remember what it felt like to think in terms of systems, dependencies, and loops.

Why Bother?Because building is a way of thinking.

Because frustration is often the doorway to understanding.

Because every now and then, itâ€™s worth checking whether your hands still know what to do.

They did.
