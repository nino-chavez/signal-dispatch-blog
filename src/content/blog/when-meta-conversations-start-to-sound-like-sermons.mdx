I’ve been doing a lot of writing and talking about how I think — how I process, how I lead, how I navigate ambiguity. That meta layer, the conversation about conversations, the thinking about thinking, has become a steady hum beneath everything.

But lately, I’ve noticed it creeping into my real-life conversations in a way that feels… off.

Instead of just talking, I catch myself stepping back, analyzing the flow, unpacking the unspoken, parsing meaning like it’s a puzzle to solve in real time. What started as a tool for clarity now risks becoming a barrier to connection.

There’s a fine line here. Between thoughtful reflection and sounding like a sermon.

It’s tempting to want to share every insight, to “hold the mirror” up for others, to invite them into the same clarity I’m chasing. But there’s a cost. Conversations can become lectures. Listening becomes monologuing.

For example, I recently caught myself in a conversation with a colleague where I was breaking down the subtext of a project disagreement — trying to explain the underlying dynamics and assumptions in painstaking detail. Instead of opening space, I shut it down. The flow stopped. The connection dimmed. I realized later they weren’t looking for a thesis — they just wanted to be heard.

I wonder if this shift signals growth — a more deliberate, intentional way of engaging with others — or if it’s a symptom of overthinking. Of losing the natural rhythm and vulnerability that make conversations feel alive.

It’s frustrating because I don’t want to lose that spontaneity. The ease of back-and-forth that isn’t about being “right” or “clear,” but about just being present.

And yet, this meta-consciousness isn’t going away. It’s part of how I process the world and my role in it.

So I’m left in this tension: how to balance the impulse to reflect and clarify with the need to listen and simply be.

Maybe this is the real work of communication — knowing when to speak, when to reflect, and when to let silence do the heavy lifting.

For now, I’m trying to stay aware of when I’m crossing that line into sermon territory. To catch myself before I over-explain or intellectualize a moment that just wants empathy or shared breath.

Because at the end of the day, conversations aren’t just about ideas. They’re about connection. And that means sometimes, you have to put the mirror down and just look someone in the eye.
