We all agree: we need a desk.

Everyone nods. The goal is clear. A desk must be built.

So I ask, “What size? What color? Where’s it going?”

And someone says:

> “Hold on — we don’t have the right screws.”

Then another:

> “Also, the screws are in six bins across three storage closets, and we need to sort them all first.”

A third chimes in:

> “We should double-check that no one’s allergic to walnut.”

Meanwhile, we’re still standing in an empty room.

🛠️ The Planning TrapThis isn't about desks. It’s about the moment projects stall — *not because no one cares*, but because the people who care most are too thoughtful to take the first step without perfect conditions.

We’ve all been there. We tell ourselves:

- “It’s more responsible to wait until we’re fully ready.”
- “We don’t want to waste effort or redo work.”
- “If we just plan better, the build will go faster.”

The intention is good. The result? **Paralysis**.

🚧 Why We Get Stuck**We confuse blockers with priorities**Screws are important — but they don’t block a conversation about size or placement.

**We over-plan before we start**Weeks of planning can be rendered obsolete the moment real work begins.

**We fear rework more than we fear inertia**So we delay. Not because we’re lazy — but because we think we’re being precise.

> 🧠 The irony? **Momentum creates better insight than speculation ever will.**

✏️ The Sketch-First ApproachWhen you're stuck, don’t fixate on the screws. Start with a sketch.

1. **Align on shape and size — fast**What kind of desk are we building?
Who’s it for?
What’s a “good enough” starting point?

You don’t need perfect clarity to reach shared understanding.

2. **Parallel path what you can**Someone can sort screws.
Someone can prototype a leg.
Someone can test whether walnut actually works in the room.

You don’t need to wait for step one to finish before step two starts.

3. **Trust that momentum teaches**Start building, and real constraints will reveal themselves.
Start testing, and useful feedback will show up.
Start moving, and the stuckness dissolves.

🔁 What About Rework?Let’s talk about the fear under the surface:

> *“If we start wrong, we’ll waste time.”*

But in truth:

- Rework isn’t failure — it’s feedback
- Adjustments mid-build are faster than plans remade endlessly
- Movement creates friction — and that friction reveals what matters

Perfect plans don’t survive contact with reality.
But real progress? That always teaches.

🧰 Start With a SketchThat’s it. That’s the whole approach.

Before you inventory every screw in the building…
Before you schedule the third pre-kickoff kickoff…
Before you wait for someone to grant permission to proceed…

**Sketch the damn desk.**
Get agreement on the big picture.
Move what you can.
Sort screws on the way.

📍 Ask yourself:- What’s your current “unbuilt desk”?
- What decisions are waiting for clarity you don’t actually need yet?
- What step could you take *today*, even if it’s not the final one?

> *Start with a sketch. Then we’ll figure out the screws.*

Let’s move.
