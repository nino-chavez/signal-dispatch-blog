> Every revolution in tech brings two markets:
> The first to **build it**, and the second to **fix what got built too fast**.

We chase the new thing — fast, hard, messy. We break rules to ship faster. The docs are sparse, the patterns immature, but the incentives all scream **go**.

And it works — until it doesn’t.

The Innovation Hangover- **Client-server to web** left behind bloated middleware and brittle intranet apps.
- **Monoliths to microservices** gave us a thousand endpoints and no observability.
- **Cloud migration** cut capex — and created incomprehensible bills.
- **AI integration** is now stuffing LLMs into workflows without controls or context.

These aren’t failures. They’re side effects of learning in real-time.

The Second Market Moves InOnce the hype cools, a **cleanup economy** emerges:

- **FinOps** teams and vendors help you understand your AWS bill.
- **Platform engineers** bring order to microservice sprawl.
- **AI auditors** tame hallucination-prone copilots.
- **Consultants and internal architects** untangle what v1 teams never had time to finish.

These roles aren’t glamorous — but they’re essential.
They don’t disrupt. They **stabilize**.

Lessons for BuildersThe point isn’t to slow down innovation — it’s to **recognize the full cycle**:

- Every new wave will be followed by the need for **refinement**.
- The second market isn’t a patch — it’s a product.
- There’s long-term opportunity in making sense of short-term chaos.

If you're burned out chasing the next big thing, take heart:
The *next* big thing might just be making this one actually work.
