*Post 1 of 5 in Muscle Memory*

It’s not that I can’t do the math. It’s that I stopped trying.

I caught myself reaching for the calculator for something like 14 x 12. Easy math. Stuff I used to do without blinking. But I didn’t trust myself to be right. Not because I didn’t know—it’s because I didn’t *want* to be wrong. That’s different.

And it’s not about the calculator. It’s about what happens when you offload something basic, over and over, until the part of you that used to just *know* starts to get quiet. You stop feeling confident. You stop practicing. You just tap the screen.

That’s the beginning of atrophy. Not physical, but cognitive. Not dramatic, but real.

The calculator isn’t the villain. I’m not anti-tools. But if I use something often enough to replace thinking entirely, I’m not getting faster—I’m getting weaker.
