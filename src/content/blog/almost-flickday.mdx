Almost Flickday
                    *From a personal nod to a creative collective*
                    
                
            
        It started as a quiet joke.

**Flickday** was my nod to *almost Friday*—that feeling when the energy shifts, the pressure lets up just enough, and you start to feel yourself again.
It was also a play on the wave of Instagram handles and hashtags that used “flick” as a shorthand for photo drops and media vibes.

But over time, it became more than that.

A Creative Space With Room to BreatheFlickday evolved into something separate from my Nino Chavez photography brand.

Where Nino Chavez Photo is precise and emotionally dialed-in—
**Flickday** is looser. Louder. More playful.
It’s where I take myself a little less seriously and stay closer to the pulse—modern vibes, pop culture, current trends, experimental collabs.

It’s become my safe space.
A space where I can try stuff, remix, and just keep moving.

Why I Needed FlickdaySometimes your personal brand can box you in.
The more defined it gets, the harder it is to color outside the lines.

Flickday gives me room to grow.
To explore ideas that don’t “fit” neatly.
To create with others.
To test out looks, styles, sounds, and energy that wouldn’t make sense anywhere else.

It’s not just about photos anymore.
It’s a launchpad for **motion**, **merch**, **moments**, and **media**.

Almost Flickday Is the MentalityThe name still works.
It’s not quite here—but close.
The moment’s about to land, and you need to be ready enough to catch it.

We don’t wait for perfection.
We move with presence.
We drop when it feels right.

Almost Flickday.
Because the moment’s already coming.
