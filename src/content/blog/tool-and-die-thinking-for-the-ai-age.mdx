Every software idea used to come with a silent price tag.

Not in dollars, but in **mental friction**.
That invisible toll of, *"This is going to be too much work."*

You know the feeling. A spark of a solution hits you mid-shower or mid-sprint — something that could solve a real problem. You jot it down. Maybe even sketch a wireframe. But by the time you think about setting up a repo, dealing with auth, or deciding on folder structure, the idea is already bleeding out.

That’s the wall I kept hitting.
Not a lack of ideas — a lack of momentum.

Until recently.

AI as the Shop FloorI've been using AI coding tools like Kilo, Lovable, GPT-4, and Claude — not just as autocomplete bots, but as structured partners. And what surprised me wasn’t just their speed. It was how they **lowered the threshold of what felt worth building**.

They made the cost of starting feel negligible.
They shrunk the overhead to something I could lean through.

Suddenly, that nagging thought — *“This will take too long”* — started fading.
Not because the work disappeared, but because the *shape* of the work changed.

And that got me thinking.

These tools don’t feel like junior devs.
They feel more like a **digital version of a tool-and-die maker**.

From Build to MoldIn manufacturing, a tool-and-die maker doesn’t just operate machines.
They **design the molds, dies, and jigs** that enable repeatable production.

The first part might take time — but once you’ve got the die, you can stamp out a hundred more. That’s what these AI tools are letting me do with code.

Instead of rewriting the same boilerplate every time I want to build, I can:

- Set up reusable prompt stacks
- Define architectural invariants
- Generate type-safe interfaces from schema
- Codify workflows once, and let AI handle the rest

I’m not just solving one problem anymore. I’m **designing the system that solves similar problems later**.

It’s a shift from *“let me code this”* to *“let me design the mold for this pattern.”*
And once that clicks, the game changes.

Creativity on the Other Side of OverheadI’ve written before about how AI helped me get over the fear of the blank page when writing.
This is the same pattern — but in code.

I no longer need to *gear up* to start a project.
No more talking myself into the effort. No more drowning in folder structures.

The idea hits, and I can build a working version within a few hours — not because I’m superhuman, but because I’m standing on top of a scaffold I didn’t have to build from scratch.

And what that really means is: **I’m experimenting more**.

Smaller ideas. Tighter feedback loops. Real output.

The irony?
AI hasn’t made me lazy — it’s made me *more likely to ship*.

Signal DispatchSo here’s what I’m sitting with:

- AI tools like Kilo are the modern shop floor.
- The mold is the new product.
- Creative friction is becoming an input problem, not an output one.

And the faster we get at designing *reusable molds*, the more ideas we get to actually test — not just imagine.

We’re not heading toward a no-code future.
We’re heading toward a **low-friction, high-momentum one**.

That’s not the end of engineering.
That’s the beginning of a new layer of authorship.
