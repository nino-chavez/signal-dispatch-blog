*Post 5 of 5 in Muscle Memory*

There’s a line between using tools and depending on them. The difference isn’t in the tool. It’s in *how* we relate to it.

I’m not anti-tool. I’m pro-awareness.

Every tool becomes a crutch if you stop asking yourself why you’re reaching for it. At first it helps. Then it becomes part of the workflow. Then it *is* the workflow.

And then one day, you realize: you don’t know how to do it without the tool.

Here’s how I map it:

- **Tool**: I choose it with intention.
- **Assistant**: I lean on it, but I still show up.
- **Crutch**: I avoid doing it myself.

It’s not about guilt. It’s about strength. Use the tool. But don’t give up the muscle that made you good in the first place.
