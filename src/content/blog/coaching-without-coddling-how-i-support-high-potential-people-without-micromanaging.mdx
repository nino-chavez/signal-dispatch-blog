← [*Coach Up or Coach Out? What I Look for Early*](/coach-up-or-coach-out-what-i-look-for-early/)

When I see the signal in someone—that early spark of clarity, curiosity, or steady problem-solving—I shift how I lead.

I don’t just assign work and disappear.
But I also don’t hover.
They don’t need a shadow. They need a signal boost.

This post is about how I handle that middle zone:
Invested, but not overbearing.
Present, but not performative.
Supportive, but not soft.

Start With the Trust, Not the TestI don’t make people earn my attention.
If I’ve already decided someone is high-potential, I start from trust.

That doesn’t mean unlimited slack.
It means I don’t second-guess every move.
I assume they’re learning, not guessing.

I might let them run a meeting.
Let them drive an outline or lead a thread.
Not because they’re “ready”—but because that’s how they get ready.

I Signal Availability Without Taking OverI try to be easy to reach, but hard to depend on.

That sounds cold, but it’s not. It’s calibration.

I’ll say things like:

- “I’m around if you need a sanity check.”
- “Push the draft as far as you can—then I’ll step in.”
- “You’ve got this. I’ll fill in any cracks.”

I want them to feel supported *without assuming I’ll catch everything.*

Because the goal isn’t perfection.
It’s building their ability to operate without needing a lifeline every time.

I Narrate My Thinking (Without Turning It Into a Lecture)When I do step in, I try to explain what I’m doing and why. Not to show off—but to make the invisible visible.

- “Here’s why I cut that section—this client reacts to buzzwords.”
- “Notice how I rephrased that? I wanted them to feel like it was their idea.”
- “I didn’t correct them in the meeting because the real conversation is happening offline.”

That kind of low-key narrating builds context fast. It gives them the why, not just the what.

I Don’t Reward DependenceIf someone keeps circling back to me for every decision, I’ll start pulling away a bit. Not to punish—but to reframe.

I might say:

- “You don’t need my approval on this. Go.”
- “What would you do if I wasn’t here?”
- “You’re thinking too small—what’s the client really trying to solve?”

That’s the nudge I offer when someone’s ready to level up—but still acting like they need training wheels.

When It Works, It Feels Like MomentumThe best part of this coaching style is when you feel them start to stretch. They bring better questions. They anticipate next steps. They start to see the field, not just their lane.

You don’t have to tell them what to do. You just have to stay in sync enough to clear the path.

That’s when I know the investment was worth it.

Final ThoughtLeadership isn’t about being hands-off or hands-on.
It’s about knowing when to stand close—and when to step back.

When someone’s worth coaching, I stay present.
But I don’t make myself the center of their growth.

Because if I do my job right, they won’t need me for long.
